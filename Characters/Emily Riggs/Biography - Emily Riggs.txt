Name: Emily Riggs
Date of Birth: 10th of July 800 A.S.
Biography:
The murder of my daughter by some unknown pirates, and what they did before ending her, fueled my burning need for vengeance.
While my siblings, Martin and Julia, joined the Liberty Navy, believing in systemic justice,
I sought a different path. Rejecting the Liberty Navy`s slow, bureaucratic pace,
I delved into the shadowy undercurrents of the Sirius Sector.
I hunted those connected to my daughters` killers through cunning, infiltration,
and a network of informants, striking from the darkness where official channels couldn`t easily reach.
Each lead I pursued with my Cutlass, the Retribution, each secret I violently or financially uncovered,
brought me closer to eliminating the people responsible.
Now since I am wanted in Liberty, my dear home, I am looking to do some cash and good on the way.
It is been told that
"There's always work to be done with the Corse".
May the Corse use my need for vengeance as I apply for eternal service!
