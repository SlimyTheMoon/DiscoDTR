The Sleeper ship Hispania suffered damage on the way to the Sirius system, with rumors of sabotage to its engines. The survivors on board were faced with a harsh choice. Half of them left the crippled colony ship around 35 A.S. to land on the first available habitable planet, which they namedCrete, and they went on to become theCorsairs. The remaining half continued on in hopes of a more suitable planet, and they
made landfall onMaltaaround 41 A.S. and would go on to become theOutcasts.

Both groups faced struggles in their first centuries of settling their new homes, and upon reintroduction to the rest of the Sirian houses, would become pirates and smugglers, raiding for supplies and peddling drugs or alien artifacts to spread their influence. To this day, the two groups remain bitter enemies, with bitter territorial clashes in the Sigma and Omicron systems.
