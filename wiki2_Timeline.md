This timeline sets out a top level summary of important events that have happened in the Sirius sector since humanity's arrival. Dating in most of Sirius uses "AS" / After Settlement, with the starting point being the arrival of the Sleeper Ship Liberty in New York. Gallia arrived later than the other Sleeper Ships, and uses its own independent dating system "AGS", or "After Gallic Settlement".

This timeline specifically provides information on the continuity used by the Discovery mod. This varies in some significant ways from the continuity of vanilla Freelancer, for example where explicit dates have been added to events that otherwise were not specified, or dates have been changed to address continuity issues accidentally introduced by the game's original developers.

This timeline contains spoilers for the original game's campaign, so please consider playing through this first.

Events are colour coded as follows:

- Colonization or loss of planets, construction or destruction of major stations.
- Formation or dissolution of factions.
- Civil conflicts, coups, wars, and peace agreements.

- The Orderactivates the SinclaireArtifactinside the Dyson Sphere, to re-engage theDaam-K'VoshHypergate network.

The activated Hypergate drags theNomad garrison fleetthrough, trapping them in another sector of the galaxy.
- The collapse of theDaam-K'Voshpower network causes theNomadMindshare to shatter. This previously allowed theNomadsto act as a networked intelligence, with the sudden severing causing many to die, go insane, or enter stasis. Indoctrinated human "thralls" are abruptly released.
