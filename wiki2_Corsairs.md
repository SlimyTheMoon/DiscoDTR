Considered by many to be the largest criminal organization in Sirius, the Corsairs inherit one half of the legacy of the Sleeper Ship Hispania. They have developed into a quasi-nation of raiders and pirates, targeting civilian and military targets with reckless abandon as they plunder the border worlds. While they spar with their Outcast brethren over territory and historic grievances, their bloodiest conflict to-date has been that with the Red Hessians, as neither side dares to give up ground in the resource-rich Omegas.

## Rumors

|  |
| Trafalgar BaseThis is the last stop for us on our Artifact run from our homeland. Maybe one day you could run Artifacts for the Corsairs. It's dangerous but pays very well. If those aren't two things that interest you then I'm wasting my time talking to you. Just make sure to stay clear of those Red Hessians.Bretonia offers many tempting targets. We soon realized that we didn't need to buy the Gold from the Junkers; we could go steal it ourselves from the Mollys and IMG. Once we dispose of the Mollys, the Bretonian underworld will be ours - the Gaians aren't a threat to our presence here.You could run reinforcement supplies to our base in Cadiz if you want to gain favor with the Corsairs. We need H-Fuel and Engine Components there to continue fighting the Red Hessians in Omega-5. The easiest way to get there is to use a jump hole in Cambridge. That is how we get into Bretonia too.There are Outcasts on this base. They arrived in Sirius on the same ship as us - the Hispania, but they refused to join us on Crete. Now they are just like everyone else - targets. It's not that we don't like them, but that won't stop us from taking one of their shipments or putting them in the airlock. Somehow I doubt those masks they wear would save them from that.Once we drop our Artifacts here, the fun begins. We raid the Trade Lanes here in Bretonia to supply our bases back home along the Edge Worlds. Before we discovered that we could make such a nice profit from selling the Artifacts, we lived solely by raiding. Bretonia is a relatively easy place to raid, compared to Rheinland or the Sigmas. The police here are not very skilled fighters, and the military are too preoccupied with a war. The only worthy opponents here are a few Bounty Hunters.Now that there has been a ban declared on Artifacts, it has been more difficult to sell as many as before, but we have compensated by raising the prices. Everyone always wants what they can't have, and now the rich fools who crave these toys will pay almost any amount for them. We drop them off here and have the Junkers handle the last leg.The Trujillo stumbled into a gas pocket in the old Somerset mining area during the early days of Corsair incursion in the New London system. The ship was lost deep inside the hazard area. Several attempts were made to rescue the Artifacts it carried, but to no avail.Halifax FreeportCorsairs who venture out toward Bretonia never expect to come across an Outcast, and this is probably one of only places you could meet one. Unfortunately I have had the displeasure of meeting several, and were it not for all the other patrons here, they would leave with more than just a few bruises.The sorts that run this base don't take kindly to gunfights breaking out, but they're happy to entertain a fistfight when tensions boil over.Nearly every face I see in this bar fills me with a certain disgust... but there are few other places around to dock up and relax, so I suppose my blaster will stay holstered for now.Freeport 1Avoiding the attention of the Corsairs involves trading them the goods they need. It's like a bribe we get paid for. The problem has been Bretonia moving into the area in force. With the BPA patrolling heavily, we're having to be much more careful with the few trade ships we send to Freeport 1. We try to make sure we're either not seen, or use unmarked freighters.If you pick up food here, you can take it to Cadiz in Omega 5 - just don't get caught by Hessians. If you feel like taking the risk, there's also the longer trip to Planet Crete, the mysterious Corsair home world. Make sure you've got a Corsair to escort you in though - they've got a habit of killing unannounced visitors.I've heard that an interested party in Omega 3 is paying the Corsairs to target certain Bretonian developments. Some drunk Corsairs were discussing it on Cadiz - I don't think they knew I could hear. I'll have to keep my ear to the ground to find out more.Cadiz BaseThis system is a war zone between Corsairs and Hessians. Thousands have died in the conflict. You'll find debris strewn throughout the system from destroyed ships lost to both sides. The fighting has come to a bloody stalemate, with each side looking for the one last push to topple the other's hold.Omega-5 is the site of a full scale war between the Corsairs and Hessians. The two factions are vying for control of this critical Jump Hole crossroads in the Omega Sector. Within the area of the no-man's-land and the Hammen Hole are numerous dead ships from both sides. Most are picked clean, but there are some that may still yield some weapons.Artifacts that come to this base are brought from throughout Corsair space. This is the last stop before entering House space, so everyone rests, refuels, and enjoys a little brotherhood before making a dash through the BAF patrols. From here the Artifacts will be shipped to Trafalgar where the Junkers will fence them to the rest of Sirius.The Side Arms you see the Corsairs carrying at this base came from Leon. You can make money on this run. And you can always pick up a piece for yourself if you have need of a better one.Omega-5 is the hub for all travel in this part of the Border Worlds. In this system you will find five Jump Holes that lead to Omega-3, Omega-7, Cambridge, Omega-11, and Omega-41. That's why it is so important we hold this system as Corsair space.The Jump Hole to Omega-41 will take you one step closer to our home system of Omicron Gamma. There you will come upon our shipyard, Tripoli, and our home world the beloved Crete, from which the Corsairs found a place to grab onto and live.Many of the supplies that keep Cadiz running come from the Junkers of Trafalgar in Bretonia. Not only do we get basics, we also ship Engine Components here.The Light Arms we manage to loot from passing transports in Cambridge and Omega 3 get sent on to Skiros and Crete.This is the Corsair forward sector. From here we organize raiding parties that venture into Cambridge and New London to resupply our bases with stolen goods. Power is something that is taken, and we have the power to take what we wish, especially in New London. The police force there is laughable.The Omega-3 Trade Lanes are a tempting target for our raiders. That space is filled with Hessians, and the Jump Hole is an ambush point for the Hessians. But once they arrive in Omega-3, goods-laden ships traveling the Lanes between Rheinland and Bretonia are easy pickings.Lagos DepotI miss the old brawls with some of the Outcasts on Yanagi. Sure, their Cardamine mutations give them greater stamina and quicker healing, but that just means you have to punch them a bit harder. More fun that way. Maybe I'll run down to Freeport 9 and see if I can find some trouble there.Welcome to our little corner of hell. When the GMG decided to force the Junkers out, probably to try and cut off our route to Rheinland, we were forced to make other arrangements. We built this base to keep the Artifact routes open, but it's also a convenient place to launch a raid on the Trade Lanes from.I just came from Crete with a cargo of Artifacts. I make this run often enough, and it can be a dull one. Sometimes I'll continue on a bit further into Rheinland, but most of the time we'll offload our Artifacts and let the Unioners, Junkers and Hogosha take it from here. Then I'll join up with a couple of our raiders and go fishing in this blue sea for cargo to take back home.Lagos may not be the most elegant piece of work, but it suits our needs. From here, we have an alternate way to trade Artifacts with the Hogosha, who can take them to Kusari and beyond. We also trade with the Unioners, who can take them into and through Rheinland, without the constant Hessian harassment in Omegas. Of course, there is the GMG to deal with here instead.I fly sorties to the Trade Lane on occasion when some of our boys need fresh cargo for the yards back home. I like this region of Sirius. No open stretches of space where you can get tagged. All you have to do here is fight off the occasional scout, or break away and slip into the endless cloud if things start to get a bit too hot.The Hogosha are our strongest ally, and they handle most, if not all, of our Kusari interests. They have considerable leeway to move Artifacts through Kusari space, which is good for us. I hear they even take them as far as Liberty. They have an understanding with Samura, so we avoid hitting Samura transports as often. Every once in a while we mock-raid one to keep up appearances. Kishiro and GMG ships are prey, like the rest.There are several groups with an interest in this region. The GMG lay claim to this space and run frequent patrols, mostly around the Trade Lanes and their Gas Mining platforms. The Hogosha, Unioners and Junkers come here to buy artifacts. Recently, the Outcasts have also become more numerous in the region, probably peddling their drugs to Rheinland and Kusari. The Golden Chrysantemums are sometimes seen with them. Last, there's the Blood Dragons who seem to enjoy a good brawl. No shortage of foes in this space, but that is nothing new to a Corsair.There's a Hole from Sigma-17 into this area not far from the base. The route back to Crete goes through there, and Omicron Theta. The Gas Miners have patrols throughout the area, and Bounty Hunters also prowl about, but overall it's not that hard to reach home from here.We get the odd Zoners in here. They prefer to stay out of the house systems. Usually they're just picking up Light Arms and Consumer Goods for their Freeport out there in Omicron Theta. They'll trade those for Food and other basics, so we don't need to haul those ourselves as much. That lot likes living on the ragged edge, and you'll find it in the Omicron systems.We've reached some understandings with the Unioners of late. We'll see how that goes, I'm not wholly trustful of any Rheinlander. Least of all those who are known to deal in Hessian Tears. Still, if they want to profit from the Artifact trade, let them. Another route into Liberty for those doesn't hurt us.The Crow nebula has its own dangers. Omicron space has a lot of radiation, but here, it are explosive pockets of gas that are the greatest risk. With a bit of practise, you can spot and avoid them though. If you plan on raiding here, it's smart to do so. Transports sometimes try to flee into those regions.Luxury Liner HawaiiWe sell the Artifacts directly to the Hogosha. There was a time when we went through the GMG, but it is always more profitable to cut out the middleman. That has annoyed those Gas Miners a lot, but that's not my problem. I brought my Artifacts from Alcudia, in Omicron Lambda.I passed out drunk at the observation deck bar a few nights ago - too many of those deadly Omnistellar Gullet Blasters I guess. While I was out someone stole my knife, probably some dirty tourist looking for a souvenir. Whoever took that knife is dead; it has been in my family for six generations.The Alien Artifacts we sell to the Hogosha here come mostly from Crete, but they can be found on a lot of planetary fragments and asteroids as well. We don't know how they got there, and frankly, don't care. These trinkets have no value to us, but they are worth their weight in gold in the houses. You could make a fortune picking up a full load at cost from Crete, then delivering them to any of the Houses. We won't stop you if you want to do that.Leon BaseWe get some of our basic supplies from the Zoner bases in the area. If it doesn't come from the Freeports, we get it from Yanagi. Any surplus we get, such as Rheinland Side Arms or Artifacts, is sent to Cadiz.This base trades in Commodities almost exclusively with other Corsair bases. The less we have to deal with outsiders the better. We get our Water and Oxygen from Crete, so this base is almost entirely free from foreign trade. The Zoners are an unwanted presence here, but we tolerate them for now.Some Zoner at Freeport 5 tried to run away with a Corsair woman. Her family is a laughing stock and will be so until her kin has killed the interloper. Her brother has gone to Hawaii to sell Artifacts; when he returns he will hunt down the fool Zoner.This base was established to secure the supply lines that lead from our homeworld to Cadiz in Omega-5. It also protects our shipments arriving from Bretonia and the Trade Lanes along the southwestern Edge Worlds. This space is the body of Corsair space. Proceed further and you will touch upon its heart.Hessians come in from Omega-11 and run attack raids on Corsairs traveling through this system. We lash back with attacks on Diamond shipments in Omega-11. The problem with the Hessians is not that they are skilled or courageous, but their numbers; kill three and five more will replace them.The Jump Holes in this system will lead you throughout southern Sirius: Omicron Gamma is to the east, Omicron Theta is north of the Freeport, Omega-5 is west of here, and Omega-11 lies to the north of this base. I tell you this because you have made yourself useful to us. Should that ever change, I will be one among many whom you will have to watch for.If you ever cheat a Corsair, there is a special punishment that will befall you. Do you know what it is to be marooned? We'll take you to a deserted chunk of rock in the middle of nowhere and leave you there. Death comes slowly in a vac-suit.I've come up against Outcasts in Sigma-19 before. They are very good at killing, as are we. Yes, even though they have greater numbers, I prefer to fight Red Hessians. I may not be afraid of death, but I don't go looking for it, either.Most zoners refuse to trade with us now because of Freeport 9, and our Pharmaceuticals stockpile is slowly running low. We're resorting to hiring Freelancers to run them from Atka.This place is mostly a rest spot for Zoners and Corsairs as they travel along the Edge Worlds. Others land here, but they have to respect our ways. Don't stay here too long or else we begin to notice that an outsider is walking a Corsair base. Once that happens you use the airlock to leave.Two of our garrison wings were redeployed to reinforce the Delos in Theta. I wish I'd get sent there as well, there is no glory to be gained here on this irradiated rock.Freeport 5Every firstborn Corsair carries the family's ancestral blade. The knife is a symbol of our struggle to live and the solidarity of each line. The blades are made from the remnants of the first ship that landed on Crete.The shipyard Tripoli requires many different Commodities to maintain production of our vessels and raiding crafts. We ship Polymers and Engine Components there from this base.We bring Artifacts to this base from Crete. It is not as lucrative a run as others, but the Zoners will find buyers for them. Either way we make our money.One of the Zoners here at this base fell in love with my daughter. When she told me of her love I sent her back to Crete. She can never return here. My son has gone looking for the man who dishonored my family.Soon I will be headed to Omega-5 to fight the Red Hessians in that part of Sirius, where it is vital that we gain control. It is every Corsair's responsibility to fly a tour of duty in the Hessian War.People often wonder how Corsairs can have such excellent ships when they are all pieced together from other stolen and salvaged vessels. Corsairs are masters of making something from nothing, and we have an advantage. Not all Artifacts are useless; many we recovered offered insight into the science of ship building.Do you know what it means when I tell you that I am a Ventru? I doubt you would understand my full meaning. Travel deeper into our worlds and perhaps then the horrible truth will make itself clear to you.The Bounty Hunters at this base are fools. Granted, we cannot attack them while they are here, but most of them will soon find themselves in Corsair ambushes when they have left the no-fighting zone that surrounds this place.One day the Corsairs may destroy this base if we find we have no more need of it. The Zoners do not realize what kind of people we are. Death is so familiar to a Corsair that delivering it is second nature. It would trouble no Corsair to put every Zoner at this base to the sword.Freeport 9If you find yourself in Rheinland anytime soon, be sure to get your hands on any Fertilizer you can. Head honchos said we need all we can get to keep the Biodomes running properly, and we're ready to pay handsomely for it, regardless of how you got them.During the takeover, some of the Bounty Hunters managed to seal themselves off in a storage room. We just cut off oxygen and they promptly opened the doors only to be gunned down. Should have seen their faces, ha!Those pesky Zoners were graciously allowed to stay, as long as they continue to work for the benefit of Crete. If you ask me, I'd just space them all but orders are orders.Ciutadella OutpostThe MOX that powers this base's larger ships is stolen, usually by our raiders that go into Bretonia. The police there are no threat to our pilots.Those bloody corporate lapdogs took over Gammu while we were forced to just watch, and because of the AI deployed minefields, we can't even attack them effectively. For now, we're just harassing their convoys with fighter wings. If all goes well, they'll just starve to death.We kept requesting reinforcements from Crete but there were just none to send our way. Those Core bastards must have waited until we were too busy elsewhere to pull this off.As the number of captured ships grew, we realized that a shipyard was needed to repair damaged vessels and build ships from stolen components and spare parts. We began to gather modules together and steal the goods necessary for the construction of this shipyard, which you can see is quite operational.Gammu treasures belong to Crete by birthright! Core has no business being here and we'll see to it that they don't stay here for long, mark my words!Casablanca BaseRheinland beer isn't that bad really. Myself, I like my tequila better, but we don't get much of that out here and the Hessians left barrels of their stuff behind. Want a beer?Rabat is quite the planet to have this base orbit around. A lot of gases to be mined and used for new weapons or fuel or whatever. Seems like the Hessians just ignored it though, the whole gas mining section was stripped out by them and who knows what they did with it. And to top it all off they caused some structural damage while leaving too. I doubt we'll be mining anything here any time soon.I still can't believe we managed to retake this base. Those Hessian dogs put up some fight. I heard stories a bunch of them got cut off from their escape ships in the engineering section when we landed here, so they locked themselves tight and kept messing around with the station power systems until a bunch of us cut through all the doors a few days later and finally cleaned them out. They are like rats, but big scary ones.We have a colony on the surface of Planet Gran Canaria. A lot of people on Crete look down on those settlers, claiming its not the Corsair way... Myself, I'm worried that without those farms, this base is going to have a harder time supporting us.I'd like to think we've gotten rid of the Hessians in this system. Fat chance. Already my hermanos are coming down with rumours that they got a new operation up north. They keep flooding through that damned jump hole in the nebula cloud next to Tangier, wish we could just close that hole for good.A Bounty Hunter jumped me near the Omega 47 hole in Omega 49 earlier this week. I fought the bastard off, but right after I was done with him a Hessian appeared. My ship was nearly out of supplies by then, so I had a tough fight. I managed to get clear and withdraw to Omega 47, but sustained heavy damage. Right now I'm grounded until my ship is fixed, but once it is, I'm going to pay that Hessian a visit. He will regret having crossed me.This base is ours... for now. Rumour already has it a Hessian counter offensive is on its way. We're a long way from home, hopefully the fleet will get here in time if those Hessians really do try to take this base back.Battlecruiser VisThe Corsairs and Outcasts are the survivors of theHispania. Half of the crew left in smaller ships and crawled into Sirius; they became the Corsairs. The rest of theHispaniacrew kept the ship running until it limped close enough to Sirius to abandon; they became the Outcasts. More than fifty percent of both groups died in the first two years after planetfall.We bring a lot of Dublin gold and Cambridge food through this route all the way to Crete. This is why this jump hole is so well defended: we can't let our enemies disrupt this lifeline. This ship is what makes it all possible.We get many different goods and basic supplies from the Freeports in nearby zones. Often times it is easier to buy what we need with Artifact income than to steal it.This battleship is the only thing that protects this nebula cloud from being overrun by the Red Hessians. It's originally designed by the Order, so it's stealthy enough to move within the cloud undetected and beat the Hessians at their own game. They have tried to destroy it by organised assault more times than I can count, but they keep failing because of the cloud density and this ship's stealth mode.Alright, Senor. I'll admit that not all of our munitions workers are here voluntarily. But those are mainly criminals of the worst sort who are paying their debt to the Empire by building munitions to defeat our enemies. Or, some of them are Hessian dogs or Mollys, that is why you see some of them arriving in shackles. I love the irony of that: they must now labor to build the munitions that will defeat their compatriots!Within the Malvadas Cloud you'll find a Jump Hole leading to Omicron Theta. There is another Jump Hole in this system in the Walker Cloud. Be careful, there are mines scattered among the carbon asteroids, but once past those you'll come upon the Jump Hole to Omega-41.The war with the Red Hessians in Omega-5 has cost the Corsairs many ships and pilots. Death is the way of the Corsair, so the lost pilots are regrettable yet acceptable. Much worse is the loss of their ships, which are often passed from one generation to the next. This shipyard is constantly running at full operational capacity to build new fighters for the front.Slavery? How can you say such things, Senor? Slavery is not only illegal within the Empire, it is a terrible and wicked crime. You must not repeat such accusations. If those words reach the wrong ears it could mean great trouble for us here. Not that have done anything wrong, but you know what bureaucratic investigations are like. We have production deadlines to meet here. The Outcasts are the slavers, not noble and honorable Corsairs. Forced prison labor is not slavery. It is justice and a righteous penance for their offenses.In 450 AS we captured our first ship. It was the Rheinland exploration vesselSchiller. Once we dispatched the crew the ship was ours, and more inner colony ships began to disappear. The Corsairs had begun a legacy that lasts to this day. We are pirates; we take what we need.Hola, Senor. Are you by chance the pilot of the transport that just delivered our newest contingent of, ah, shall we say, workers? Munitions manufacturing is a dangerous and exhausting occupation, there's no doubt of that. We burn through workers like an Outcast through cardamine. Ah, well, what I mean to say is, our workers rotate back out to their homes frequently. While here, they are well paid and well treated, I assure you. Let me offer you a drink.Planet Gran CanariaMany Bounty Hunters come to this system. It's what we call a target-rich environment. You've got Corsairs, Mollies, Hessians...Even the occasional Gaian that tries to take a vacation down here. Well, the last one that came went for an extended stay on Newgate instead, and the sum I got for it netted me a month's vacation myself. Heh.Hunting Corsairs? No, I'm tracking someone else. My brother to be exact. The lad left Bretonia two weeks ago with the idea of chasing a high-value mark. Last I heared he was headed to Omega-48, but I haven't heared from him since. If the Corsairs already got him, he's a goner, that's for sure.I'm just getting my ship serviced and refuled, after that I'm off to Dublin. After having survived the Omega borderworlds for the past two months, a bit of time in good old Dub is going to be a nice, relaxing change of pace. There's plenty of Corsairs and Mollies out there to make a living as a Hunter.There's a jump hole in the east of this system, which leads to Omega-48. I haven't gone there yet, but I'll head out to find it soon. There's a ton of Corsairs and Hessians down there, along with a few of their bases, so there'll be plenty of marks to collect on. I'll have to be cautious though, I heard tale of entire fleets slugging it out down there. Wouldn't want to get caught in between.Planet PygarCongratulations, you're one of the first people here who's not too fine to talk to me. Folks around here really do make you feel right at home, no? Oh well, just making sure there is nothing suspicious going on here. Pygar's pretty close to Crete and we'd rather not have a little 'incident' here. That guy over there, though. No, the one with the Order uniform. I swear he's up to something. Can't trust those people, acting all secret.Planet New London, Landing SiteI dont know what you are thinking, but it is not what you think.I would very much like to kill everyone in this bar. Why? Nobody gets along, not for long anyway. If criminals like us spent less time killing eachother fighting over scraps, we might have a chance against the big boys.On one hand I am sad this planet did not burn, on the other hand I am glad for a place to sell my stolen goods.Planet CreteThe supplies we use to run our bases are either stolen or purchased with the money we make from selling stolen goods. The Construction Machinery here is almost all stolen.The proximity of our base Cadiz to the Trade Lanes and Bretonian space makes it a primary source of stolen goods for the Corsairs. H-Fuel, Pharmaceuticals, and Polymers are frequently shipped here from that base.We traveled to Sirius on a sleeper ship like everyone else. Our ship, theHispania, fell victim to sabotage en route. We were forced to abandon her and make our way through the void. We found this planet with barely enough supplies to feed half of us. Few crops would grow in these infertile sands, and our numbers dwindled to almost nothing.The Malvada Nube serves as the key adult initiation ritual within the close families of the Corsairs. Young pilots must fly a stripped ship into the cloud, find an Artifact, and return safely to Crete. Almost 30% never return. The radiation levels are high, and it is rumored that there are strange beings that guard the best areas. By tradition, a lost trainee's ship and body are never recovered, just left as a reminder to future generations of failure's cost.Many think our rites of initiation are barbaric, but we can't feed, clothe, and train every Corsair born. The initiation keeps our population problems in check. At the age of sixteen every Corsair must fly into the radioactive Malvadas Cloud in an unshielded ship and return with an Artifact. Some return as they left, others become sterile, and the rest die.There were Artifacts all over Crete at one time. Most of those have been sold now, but we still find Artifacts in the Malvadas and Napo Clouds. Any Corsair could have many of the alien trinkets, but they have no function and are therefore meaningless, except for trade. Let some other fool spend his money on them.If you hear of any rumors of slavery within the Empire, be sure to bring it to my investigators' attention. We will track them down and get to the bottom of the matter, I assure you. I believe all such rumors to be paranoid chatter or Hessian inspired lies, but it is my duty to pursue them all until the purity of the Corsair way of life is evident to all of Sirius.The Artifacts we trade in Yanagi more than pay for the Side Arms, Consumer Goods, and Fertilizers that we bring to this base on our return.The Corsairs are consolidated into family lines that are brought together and strengthened by marriage. Our society is a closed one; we do not wish to dilute our blood with the seeds of weaker men. It is possible to fly with the Corsairs and to be trusted by us, but an outsider will never marry into the families of Crete.There is a legend that a secret Jump Hole lies at the center of the Graveyard of the Innocents in the Malvada Cloud. A young Corsair completing his adulthood initiation rites stumbled across it while trying to find his Artifact. He entered it and emerged in an uncharted system. Strange alien ships soon appeared in the distance, and he fled for his life back to known territory. Few people believe the story.The second year after planetfall we ran out of Food. The family leaders gathered together and decided upon a course of action. The Ventru line was chosen, and they gave themselves up to be butchered. Every Corsair is a Ventru, though the line no longer lives, they are a part of us all.Hola, Senor. Do you have any information about slavery within the Empire? My team of investigators is ready to take your statement, if you do. We will not tolerate this loathsome practice that has been so heinously promoted by the Outcasts. Those drug abusing degenerates think nothing of exploiting the vulnerable in their quest for cheap cardamine and domination over their peaceful neighbors.The Zoners at Freeport 5 and Freeport 9 have access to many of the supplies we use at this base. In exchange for the Oxygen and Water we have in abundance here we are able to get all manner of goods.Corsairs have the purest hearts and are the most fair minded citizens in all of Sirius, I declare! We shall crush the despicable slave trade and its wicked promoters wherever we find them. I have heard far too many rumors of this practice existing at remote Corsair installations. Personally, I do not believe them. The Etna Six were an aberration brought on by extended exposure to Outcasts within the Etna battle zone. Such greed and casual disregard for humanity is totally foreign to the average Corsair.The Artifacts that end up in Manhattan usually pass through Bretonia's market first. We export Alien Artifacts to the Junker base Trafalgar. I don't suppose there would be anything to stop you from doing the same.The first outsider accepted by the Corsairs was a freelancer named John Bown. He fought several of our best pilots when he entered the system, so he was able to pass. He left with a cargo bay full of Artifacts, and that is when trade began. Our economy flourished, allowing us to feed more of our people.Tripoli ShipyardCadiz is an important base for the Corsairs. It is one of our primary supply depots from which we receive many Commodities.Now that our shipyard is operational, we have begun gathering the components to build a biodome. If we could have one of those domes under direct control of the Corsairs, none of us would ever want again. It would be a new age, a time without hunger. Even now we come closer and closer to it.The MOX that powers this base's larger ships is stolen, usually by our raiders that go into Bretonia. The police there are no threat to our pilots.We get many different goods and basic supplies from the Freeports in nearby zones. Often times it is easier to buy what we need with Artifact income than to steal it.Engine Components, Construction Machinery, and Gold are Commodities that are crucial to our ship-building operations here. They are either stolen or purchased from Trafalgar and shipped here.I don't know why so many resources are going into the construction of capital ships. I mean, they look imposing on the battlefield, but they're so inefficient. They are also cumbersome, and have high crew requirements. That crew could all be flying fighters and bombers instead, which are much more useful in a system like Omega-5.IMG prospectors have been sneaking into the system recently, looking for Artifacts. They don't understand whose space they are entering, until we catch them. Then their last few moments are spent thinking deeply about the subject. The Artifact trade is our resource; anyone who endangers it must be killed.Within the Malvadas Cloud you'll find a Jump Hole leading to Omicron Theta. There is another Jump Hole in this system in the Walker Cloud. Be careful, there are mines scattered among the carbon asteroids, but once past those you'll come upon the Jump Hole to Omega-41.The warships under construction here will cement our reputation as the most fearsome group in all of Sirius. They will allow us to finally break through the defences of the weakening houses, and claim their territory as our own. I can't wait until I can walk on the surface of planet Cambridge. When that day comes, it will all be thanks to these ships.The war with the Red Hessians in Omega-5 has cost the Corsairs many ships and pilots. Death is the way of the Corsair, so the lost pilots are regrettable yet acceptable. Much worse is the loss of their ships, which are often passed from one generation to the next. This shipyard is constantly running at full operational capacity to build new fighters for the front.As the number of captured ships grew, we realized that a shipyard was needed to repair damaged vessels and build ships from stolen components and spare parts. We began to gather modules together and steal the goods necessary for the construction of this shipyard, which you can see is quite operational.Newport supplies us with several essential Commodities. We get a majority of our Optronics, Side Arms, and Basic Alloys from that base.In 450 AS we captured our first ship. It was the Rheinland exploration vesselSchiller. Once we dispatched the crew the ship was ours, and more inner colony ships began to disappear. The Corsairs had begun a legacy that lasts to this day. We are pirates; we take what we need.The Corsairs and Outcasts are the survivors of theHispania. Half of the crew left in smaller ships and crawled into Sirius; they became the Corsairs. The rest of theHispaniacrew kept the ship running until it limped close enough to Sirius to abandon; they became the Outcasts. More than fifty percent of both groups died in the first two years after planetfall.Battlecruiser SantanderI saw a Molly clip the wings off one of my pack when we were out on patrol. Bastard had the audacity to mount one of our turrets. It's good to know they like trophies, I think I'll start taking a few to teach them respect.My brethren disagree with me, but destroying the Hood was a mistake. Yes, the Guild were more favorable to the Mollys than us, but it would have at least given us extra power at the bargaining table with the Junkers of Trafalgar. Without this crucial alternative, we're being fleeced for more than we have, this isn't sustainable. And if the Mollys, by some miracle, drag this on for long enough - we will have to withdraw.These so-called Mollys have done us a service. They've driven the Armed Forces out of the system and ripened it for us to rule. The only problem is that our supply chain is.. tenuous at best. If we weren't so inhibited it would be a simple chore to flatten these would-be separatists and send Correos full of gold back to Crete.Battleship AthosThis ship takes five days to complete a full patrol before coming back to the C6 Platform. We'll be launching again tomorrow once the engines are refuelled and the crew assignments are sorted.I wish I was back at Thira Colony with my family. Still, I know I'm protecting them by being here, with the rest of the crew, defending the system from whatever is out there.See that green cloud? That's what we're here for, I think. Whatever attacked those scouts afew years back, I reckon it came from in there.Battlecruiser PenitenceI came here with supplies recently, figured the herculean effort this ship is undertaking would make ammo and parts necessary.Me and my wing have actually witnessed the destruction of Bautzen and the following battle. Much to Manuel's dismay, we kept our distance, no reason to interfere with our enemies killing each other, si?Our enemies have grown complacent, feeling rest assured that our recent shortcomings would extend into the future. Complacency kills, we'll show them how.We have a golden opportunity to take over the system, now that the Military and Hessians bled each other dry, but between sending supplies to the Santander and having to keep Zoners in Theta pacified, head honchos can't send us all the men we need. Blast it all.Being part of this ship's raiding party is a big honour. You have to be a shining example of what it truly means to be a Corsair to even be considered, they won't accept anything less.This ship has a lot of weight riding on it, first of her class means she'll set a legacy for years to come. It's a legacy we'll labour to be worthy of, I can promise you that much.Me and my wing have actually witnessed the destruction of Bautzen by pure chance. Much to Manuel's dismay, we kept our distance, no reason to interfere with our enemies killing each other, si?The charge this ship is spearheading is a rude awakening to everyone delusional enough to think they're safe from us. If you're here now, then I suppose that means you're smart enough not to mess with us. Keep it that way.Some say we're too tough when it comes to standards. Tell me that again when you're outnumbered two to one and your only saving grace is discipline.We have a golden opportunity to take over the system, now that the Military and Hessians bled each other dry, but between sending supplies to the stranded Santander and having to keep Zoners in Theta pacified, head honchos won't send us the men we need. Blast it all.I got assigned to the raiding detachment aboard this ship, seen plenty of action since we settled in to give Rheinland a bloody nose. But I'm more eager to put the squeeze on those Hessians when we get the chance, have to teach them where they stand.Evia Research ComplexThis research station contains the most advanced research equipment that the Corsair nation has available to it. Unfortunately, most Corsairs aren't allowed on to this installation due to the strict security rules. It might be unfair, but it helps to keep the trigger-happy teenagers away from the delicate process of xenoarcheology.I work as one of the warehouse managers here on Evia. You wouldn't believe how fast we can get through a full stockpile of Xeno Relics. It's my job to make sure that we never run out of resources with which the reserch here is conducted. It's a hard job, and I blame the Core.The Thales anomaly is a sight to behold isn't it? Have to wonder what the true purpose of it is, and what secrets lie within.The edibles we get from the scientists on Crete are some of the best tasting I've ever had. I'm no connoisseur of food, but I've rarely felt as full before as I have now. My friends keep telling me how lucky I am to get a contract as a construction worker here. I completely agree.My relatives are all soldiers serving on Leon or Cadiz. In one sense, I'm lucky to have a comfortable job researching Artifacts and observing the Thales anomaly, but I sometimes long for combat on the front lines. Maybe the grass is always greener on the other side. I might make a trip up there, once I save enough credits to buy a better ship from Tripoli.I’ve been a bartender and cook here for almost 20 years. I used to be on the front lines, raiding and pirating convoys in the Sigmas, until a Bounty Hunter nearly took my life. That’s when I said, 'Screw it - this kind of life will only land me in an early grave.' Here, I have a warm room, good food, freedom, and the constant thrill of my friends uncovering something new - whether it’s through Xeno Relics, the Thales Anomaly, or traditional Artifacts. I think I’ll stay on Evia as long as my health allows.Battleship DelosFreeport 9 occupation seemed like a great idea at first, but those Outcasts sure are trying to change our minds. At least we don't need to worry about the Bounty Hunters Guild nearly as much as we used to.Fes may have been a relic compared to the newer ships, but it was still a symbol of the Empire's might. Its crew fought to the last man, and so will Delos, should it come to that.We're keeping at least thirty-percent of our fighters on emergency alert, ready to deploy within 2 minutes, and another thirty on high alert, deployable within 5 minutes. These cardamine-addicts strike quick and hard, we need to be able to respond on a moment's notice.Petra BaseMost Rogues enjoy a good brawl, but things often get messy. After the last brawl in the bar, I was in Medical for weeks with three busted ribs. Three ribs from one punch! Thank God he wasn't using his knife...There's only two kinds of Rogues that really scare me: Ones short on booze, and ones short on Cardi. Then there's the lot returning from a stay on Sugarland. Those can be unstable and best avoided completely.Rogues got us shipping all sorts of stuff down to Fort McMurray ya? No idea why, but y'know, they pay good money. Mostly. Reckon they got something big going down.So there we were minding our own business in the bar, when this giant monster of a bloke walks up and tells us we're sitting in his chair. We point out it's a Junker base, so it's our bloody chair and he says "Yeah, but it's our system, and if you don't shift I'll rip out your damn spines." That point we realised who he was. We moved.I don't mind Rogues dropping by now and again, but that last one... I thought he was about to rip Martin in half! I think we've got an understanding now, though. We don't get in their way, and they make sure most of their unneeded cargo comes our way.Rogues round these parts are a different breed to the ones you find elsewhere. These poor buggers got the bosses breathing down their necks the whole time. Makes em scared and scared Rogues are scary Rogues. They'll cut you soon as look you. Just in case that's what the boss wants. Makes living here kinda erratic.Battleship ProxThese new crew members are really difficult to teach. I was proficient at sharing my knowledge of operating all the previous warships' the interior systems, but applying that knowledge to future Tribunus personnel is a whole different challenge. They're using technology I've never seen before - and I’ve been in this business for a long time. I suppose I’ll get used to it eventually, but it feels like I’m learning the trade all over again.My friends and I train various rookie capital ship crews here on Prox. It feels good to be among the best, especially in times when many don’t make it to their later years. We get plenty of perks for the job - first pick of the food, clean places to relax. The only real drawback is keeping any information about Prox a secret. But for benefits like this, I wouldn’t tell a soul.I love the Prox. It stands as a magnificent display of strength and serves as an excellent education center. Who cares if it can't leave Gamma? It never needs to. I'll be a happy man retiring here. | Trafalgar Base | This is the last stop for us on our Artifact run from our homeland. Maybe one day you could run Artifacts for the Corsairs. It's dangerous but pays very well. If those aren't two things that interest you then I'm wasting my time talking to you. Just make sure to stay clear of those Red Hessians.Bretonia offers many tempting targets. We soon realized that we didn't need to buy the Gold from the Junkers; we could go steal it ourselves from the Mollys and IMG. Once we dispose of the Mollys, the Bretonian underworld will be ours - the Gaians aren't a threat to our presence here.You could run reinforcement supplies to our base in Cadiz if you want to gain favor with the Corsairs. We need H-Fuel and Engine Components there to continue fighting the Red Hessians in Omega-5. The easiest way to get there is to use a jump hole in Cambridge. That is how we get into Bretonia too.There are Outcasts on this base. They arrived in Sirius on the same ship as us - the Hispania, but they refused to join us on Crete. Now they are just like everyone else - targets. It's not that we don't like them, but that won't stop us from taking one of their shipments or putting them in the airlock. Somehow I doubt those masks they wear would save them from that.Once we drop our Artifacts here, the fun begins. We raid the Trade Lanes here in Bretonia to supply our bases back home along the Edge Worlds. Before we discovered that we could make such a nice profit from selling the Artifacts, we lived solely by raiding. Bretonia is a relatively easy place to raid, compared to Rheinland or the Sigmas. The police here are not very skilled fighters, and the military are too preoccupied with a war. The only worthy opponents here are a few Bounty Hunters.Now that there has been a ban declared on Artifacts, it has been more difficult to sell as many as before, but we have compensated by raising the prices. Everyone always wants what they can't have, and now the rich fools who crave these toys will pay almost any amount for them. We drop them off here and have the Junkers handle the last leg.The Trujillo stumbled into a gas pocket in the old Somerset mining area during the early days of Corsair incursion in the New London system. The ship was lost deep inside the hazard area. Several attempts were made to rescue the Artifacts it carried, but to no avail. | Halifax Freeport | Corsairs who venture out toward Bretonia never expect to come across an Outcast, and this is probably one of only places you could meet one. Unfortunately I have had the displeasure of meeting several, and were it not for all the other patrons here, they would leave with more than just a few bruises.The sorts that run this base don't take kindly to gunfights breaking out, but they're happy to entertain a fistfight when tensions boil over.Nearly every face I see in this bar fills me with a certain disgust... but there are few other places around to dock up and relax, so I suppose my blaster will stay holstered for now. | Freeport 1 | Avoiding the attention of the Corsairs involves trading them the goods they need. It's like a bribe we get paid for. The problem has been Bretonia moving into the area in force. With the BPA patrolling heavily, we're having to be much more careful with the few trade ships we send to Freeport 1. We try to make sure we're either not seen, or use unmarked freighters.If you pick up food here, you can take it to Cadiz in Omega 5 - just don't get caught by Hessians. If you feel like taking the risk, there's also the longer trip to Planet Crete, the mysterious Corsair home world. Make sure you've got a Corsair to escort you in though - they've got a habit of killing unannounced visitors.I've heard that an interested party in Omega 3 is paying the Corsairs to target certain Bretonian developments. Some drunk Corsairs were discussing it on Cadiz - I don't think they knew I could hear. I'll have to keep my ear to the ground to find out more. | Cadiz Base | This system is a war zone between Corsairs and Hessians. Thousands have died in the conflict. You'll find debris strewn throughout the system from destroyed ships lost to both sides. The fighting has come to a bloody stalemate, with each side looking for the one last push to topple the other's hold.Omega-5 is the site of a full scale war between the Corsairs and Hessians. The two factions are vying for control of this critical Jump Hole crossroads in the Omega Sector. Within the area of the no-man's-land and the Hammen Hole are numerous dead ships from both sides. Most are picked clean, but there are some that may still yield some weapons.Artifacts that come to this base are brought from throughout Corsair space. This is the last stop before entering House space, so everyone rests, refuels, and enjoys a little brotherhood before making a dash through the BAF patrols. From here the Artifacts will be shipped to Trafalgar where the Junkers will fence them to the rest of Sirius.The Side Arms you see the Corsairs carrying at this base came from Leon. You can make money on this run. And you can always pick up a piece for yourself if you have need of a better one.Omega-5 is the hub for all travel in this part of the Border Worlds. In this system you will find five Jump Holes that lead to Omega-3, Omega-7, Cambridge, Omega-11, and Omega-41. That's why it is so important we hold this system as Corsair space.The Jump Hole to Omega-41 will take you one step closer to our home system of Omicron Gamma. There you will come upon our shipyard, Tripoli, and our home world the beloved Crete, from which the Corsairs found a place to grab onto and live.Many of the supplies that keep Cadiz running come from the Junkers of Trafalgar in Bretonia. Not only do we get basics, we also ship Engine Components here.The Light Arms we manage to loot from passing transports in Cambridge and Omega 3 get sent on to Skiros and Crete.This is the Corsair forward sector. From here we organize raiding parties that venture into Cambridge and New London to resupply our bases with stolen goods. Power is something that is taken, and we have the power to take what we wish, especially in New London. The police force there is laughable.The Omega-3 Trade Lanes are a tempting target for our raiders. That space is filled with Hessians, and the Jump Hole is an ambush point for the Hessians. But once they arrive in Omega-3, goods-laden ships traveling the Lanes between Rheinland and Bretonia are easy pickings. | Lagos Depot | I miss the old brawls with some of the Outcasts on Yanagi. Sure, their Cardamine mutations give them greater stamina and quicker healing, but that just means you have to punch them a bit harder. More fun that way. Maybe I'll run down to Freeport 9 and see if I can find some trouble there.Welcome to our little corner of hell. When the GMG decided to force the Junkers out, probably to try and cut off our route to Rheinland, we were forced to make other arrangements. We built this base to keep the Artifact routes open, but it's also a convenient place to launch a raid on the Trade Lanes from.I just came from Crete with a cargo of Artifacts. I make this run often enough, and it can be a dull one. Sometimes I'll continue on a bit further into Rheinland, but most of the time we'll offload our Artifacts and let the Unioners, Junkers and Hogosha take it from here. Then I'll join up with a couple of our raiders and go fishing in this blue sea for cargo to take back home.Lagos may not be the most elegant piece of work, but it suits our needs. From here, we have an alternate way to trade Artifacts with the Hogosha, who can take them to Kusari and beyond. We also trade with the Unioners, who can take them into and through Rheinland, without the constant Hessian harassment in Omegas. Of course, there is the GMG to deal with here instead.I fly sorties to the Trade Lane on occasion when some of our boys need fresh cargo for the yards back home. I like this region of Sirius. No open stretches of space where you can get tagged. All you have to do here is fight off the occasional scout, or break away and slip into the endless cloud if things start to get a bit too hot.The Hogosha are our strongest ally, and they handle most, if not all, of our Kusari interests. They have considerable leeway to move Artifacts through Kusari space, which is good for us. I hear they even take them as far as Liberty. They have an understanding with Samura, so we avoid hitting Samura transports as often. Every once in a while we mock-raid one to keep up appearances. Kishiro and GMG ships are prey, like the rest.There are several groups with an interest in this region. The GMG lay claim to this space and run frequent patrols, mostly around the Trade Lanes and their Gas Mining platforms. The Hogosha, Unioners and Junkers come here to buy artifacts. Recently, the Outcasts have also become more numerous in the region, probably peddling their drugs to Rheinland and Kusari. The Golden Chrysantemums are sometimes seen with them. Last, there's the Blood Dragons who seem to enjoy a good brawl. No shortage of foes in this space, but that is nothing new to a Corsair.There's a Hole from Sigma-17 into this area not far from the base. The route back to Crete goes through there, and Omicron Theta. The Gas Miners have patrols throughout the area, and Bounty Hunters also prowl about, but overall it's not that hard to reach home from here.We get the odd Zoners in here. They prefer to stay out of the house systems. Usually they're just picking up Light Arms and Consumer Goods for their Freeport out there in Omicron Theta. They'll trade those for Food and other basics, so we don't need to haul those ourselves as much. That lot likes living on the ragged edge, and you'll find it in the Omicron systems.We've reached some understandings with the Unioners of late. We'll see how that goes, I'm not wholly trustful of any Rheinlander. Least of all those who are known to deal in Hessian Tears. Still, if they want to profit from the Artifact trade, let them. Another route into Liberty for those doesn't hurt us.The Crow nebula has its own dangers. Omicron space has a lot of radiation, but here, it are explosive pockets of gas that are the greatest risk. With a bit of practise, you can spot and avoid them though. If you plan on raiding here, it's smart to do so. Transports sometimes try to flee into those regions. | Luxury Liner Hawaii | We sell the Artifacts directly to the Hogosha. There was a time when we went through the GMG, but it is always more profitable to cut out the middleman. That has annoyed those Gas Miners a lot, but that's not my problem. I brought my Artifacts from Alcudia, in Omicron Lambda.I passed out drunk at the observation deck bar a few nights ago - too many of those deadly Omnistellar Gullet Blasters I guess. While I was out someone stole my knife, probably some dirty tourist looking for a souvenir. Whoever took that knife is dead; it has been in my family for six generations.The Alien Artifacts we sell to the Hogosha here come mostly from Crete, but they can be found on a lot of planetary fragments and asteroids as well. We don't know how they got there, and frankly, don't care. These trinkets have no value to us, but they are worth their weight in gold in the houses. You could make a fortune picking up a full load at cost from Crete, then delivering them to any of the Houses. We won't stop you if you want to do that. | Leon Base | We get some of our basic supplies from the Zoner bases in the area. If it doesn't come from the Freeports, we get it from Yanagi. Any surplus we get, such as Rheinland Side Arms or Artifacts, is sent to Cadiz.This base trades in Commodities almost exclusively with other Corsair bases. The less we have to deal with outsiders the better. We get our Water and Oxygen from Crete, so this base is almost entirely free from foreign trade. The Zoners are an unwanted presence here, but we tolerate them for now.Some Zoner at Freeport 5 tried to run away with a Corsair woman. Her family is a laughing stock and will be so until her kin has killed the interloper. Her brother has gone to Hawaii to sell Artifacts; when he returns he will hunt down the fool Zoner.This base was established to secure the supply lines that lead from our homeworld to Cadiz in Omega-5. It also protects our shipments arriving from Bretonia and the Trade Lanes along the southwestern Edge Worlds. This space is the body of Corsair space. Proceed further and you will touch upon its heart.Hessians come in from Omega-11 and run attack raids on Corsairs traveling through this system. We lash back with attacks on Diamond shipments in Omega-11. The problem with the Hessians is not that they are skilled or courageous, but their numbers; kill three and five more will replace them.The Jump Holes in this system will lead you throughout southern Sirius: Omicron Gamma is to the east, Omicron Theta is north of the Freeport, Omega-5 is west of here, and Omega-11 lies to the north of this base. I tell you this because you have made yourself useful to us. Should that ever change, I will be one among many whom you will have to watch for.If you ever cheat a Corsair, there is a special punishment that will befall you. Do you know what it is to be marooned? We'll take you to a deserted chunk of rock in the middle of nowhere and leave you there. Death comes slowly in a vac-suit.I've come up against Outcasts in Sigma-19 before. They are very good at killing, as are we. Yes, even though they have greater numbers, I prefer to fight Red Hessians. I may not be afraid of death, but I don't go looking for it, either.Most zoners refuse to trade with us now because of Freeport 9, and our Pharmaceuticals stockpile is slowly running low. We're resorting to hiring Freelancers to run them from Atka.This place is mostly a rest spot for Zoners and Corsairs as they travel along the Edge Worlds. Others land here, but they have to respect our ways. Don't stay here too long or else we begin to notice that an outsider is walking a Corsair base. Once that happens you use the airlock to leave.Two of our garrison wings were redeployed to reinforce the Delos in Theta. I wish I'd get sent there as well, there is no glory to be gained here on this irradiated rock. | Freeport 5 | Every firstborn Corsair carries the family's ancestral blade. The knife is a symbol of our struggle to live and the solidarity of each line. The blades are made from the remnants of the first ship that landed on Crete.The shipyard Tripoli requires many different Commodities to maintain production of our vessels and raiding crafts. We ship Polymers and Engine Components there from this base.We bring Artifacts to this base from Crete. It is not as lucrative a run as others, but the Zoners will find buyers for them. Either way we make our money.One of the Zoners here at this base fell in love with my daughter. When she told me of her love I sent her back to Crete. She can never return here. My son has gone looking for the man who dishonored my family.Soon I will be headed to Omega-5 to fight the Red Hessians in that part of Sirius, where it is vital that we gain control. It is every Corsair's responsibility to fly a tour of duty in the Hessian War.People often wonder how Corsairs can have such excellent ships when they are all pieced together from other stolen and salvaged vessels. Corsairs are masters of making something from nothing, and we have an advantage. Not all Artifacts are useless; many we recovered offered insight into the science of ship building.Do you know what it means when I tell you that I am a Ventru? I doubt you would understand my full meaning. Travel deeper into our worlds and perhaps then the horrible truth will make itself clear to you.The Bounty Hunters at this base are fools. Granted, we cannot attack them while they are here, but most of them will soon find themselves in Corsair ambushes when they have left the no-fighting zone that surrounds this place.One day the Corsairs may destroy this base if we find we have no more need of it. The Zoners do not realize what kind of people we are. Death is so familiar to a Corsair that delivering it is second nature. It would trouble no Corsair to put every Zoner at this base to the sword. | Freeport 9 | If you find yourself in Rheinland anytime soon, be sure to get your hands on any Fertilizer you can. Head honchos said we need all we can get to keep the Biodomes running properly, and we're ready to pay handsomely for it, regardless of how you got them.During the takeover, some of the Bounty Hunters managed to seal themselves off in a storage room. We just cut off oxygen and they promptly opened the doors only to be gunned down. Should have seen their faces, ha!Those pesky Zoners were graciously allowed to stay, as long as they continue to work for the benefit of Crete. If you ask me, I'd just space them all but orders are orders. | Ciutadella Outpost | The MOX that powers this base's larger ships is stolen, usually by our raiders that go into Bretonia. The police there are no threat to our pilots.Those bloody corporate lapdogs took over Gammu while we were forced to just watch, and because of the AI deployed minefields, we can't even attack them effectively. For now, we're just harassing their convoys with fighter wings. If all goes well, they'll just starve to death.We kept requesting reinforcements from Crete but there were just none to send our way. Those Core bastards must have waited until we were too busy elsewhere to pull this off.As the number of captured ships grew, we realized that a shipyard was needed to repair damaged vessels and build ships from stolen components and spare parts. We began to gather modules together and steal the goods necessary for the construction of this shipyard, which you can see is quite operational.Gammu treasures belong to Crete by birthright! Core has no business being here and we'll see to it that they don't stay here for long, mark my words! | Casablanca Base | Rheinland beer isn't that bad really. Myself, I like my tequila better, but we don't get much of that out here and the Hessians left barrels of their stuff behind. Want a beer?Rabat is quite the planet to have this base orbit around. A lot of gases to be mined and used for new weapons or fuel or whatever. Seems like the Hessians just ignored it though, the whole gas mining section was stripped out by them and who knows what they did with it. And to top it all off they caused some structural damage while leaving too. I doubt we'll be mining anything here any time soon.I still can't believe we managed to retake this base. Those Hessian dogs put up some fight. I heard stories a bunch of them got cut off from their escape ships in the engineering section when we landed here, so they locked themselves tight and kept messing around with the station power systems until a bunch of us cut through all the doors a few days later and finally cleaned them out. They are like rats, but big scary ones.We have a colony on the surface of Planet Gran Canaria. A lot of people on Crete look down on those settlers, claiming its not the Corsair way... Myself, I'm worried that without those farms, this base is going to have a harder time supporting us.I'd like to think we've gotten rid of the Hessians in this system. Fat chance. Already my hermanos are coming down with rumours that they got a new operation up north. They keep flooding through that damned jump hole in the nebula cloud next to Tangier, wish we could just close that hole for good.A Bounty Hunter jumped me near the Omega 47 hole in Omega 49 earlier this week. I fought the bastard off, but right after I was done with him a Hessian appeared. My ship was nearly out of supplies by then, so I had a tough fight. I managed to get clear and withdraw to Omega 47, but sustained heavy damage. Right now I'm grounded until my ship is fixed, but once it is, I'm going to pay that Hessian a visit. He will regret having crossed me.This base is ours... for now. Rumour already has it a Hessian counter offensive is on its way. We're a long way from home, hopefully the fleet will get here in time if those Hessians really do try to take this base back. | Battlecruiser Vis | The Corsairs and Outcasts are the survivors of theHispania. Half of the crew left in smaller ships and crawled into Sirius; they became the Corsairs. The rest of theHispaniacrew kept the ship running until it limped close enough to Sirius to abandon; they became the Outcasts. More than fifty percent of both groups died in the first two years after planetfall.We bring a lot of Dublin gold and Cambridge food through this route all the way to Crete. This is why this jump hole is so well defended: we can't let our enemies disrupt this lifeline. This ship is what makes it all possible.We get many different goods and basic supplies from the Freeports in nearby zones. Often times it is easier to buy what we need with Artifact income than to steal it.This battleship is the only thing that protects this nebula cloud from being overrun by the Red Hessians. It's originally designed by the Order, so it's stealthy enough to move within the cloud undetected and beat the Hessians at their own game. They have tried to destroy it by organised assault more times than I can count, but they keep failing because of the cloud density and this ship's stealth mode.Alright, Senor. I'll admit that not all of our munitions workers are here voluntarily. But those are mainly criminals of the worst sort who are paying their debt to the Empire by building munitions to defeat our enemies. Or, some of them are Hessian dogs or Mollys, that is why you see some of them arriving in shackles. I love the irony of that: they must now labor to build the munitions that will defeat their compatriots!Within the Malvadas Cloud you'll find a Jump Hole leading to Omicron Theta. There is another Jump Hole in this system in the Walker Cloud. Be careful, there are mines scattered among the carbon asteroids, but once past those you'll come upon the Jump Hole to Omega-41.The war with the Red Hessians in Omega-5 has cost the Corsairs many ships and pilots. Death is the way of the Corsair, so the lost pilots are regrettable yet acceptable. Much worse is the loss of their ships, which are often passed from one generation to the next. This shipyard is constantly running at full operational capacity to build new fighters for the front.Slavery? How can you say such things, Senor? Slavery is not only illegal within the Empire, it is a terrible and wicked crime. You must not repeat such accusations. If those words reach the wrong ears it could mean great trouble for us here. Not that have done anything wrong, but you know what bureaucratic investigations are like. We have production deadlines to meet here. The Outcasts are the slavers, not noble and honorable Corsairs. Forced prison labor is not slavery. It is justice and a righteous penance for their offenses.In 450 AS we captured our first ship. It was the Rheinland exploration vesselSchiller. Once we dispatched the crew the ship was ours, and more inner colony ships began to disappear. The Corsairs had begun a legacy that lasts to this day. We are pirates; we take what we need.Hola, Senor. Are you by chance the pilot of the transport that just delivered our newest contingent of, ah, shall we say, workers? Munitions manufacturing is a dangerous and exhausting occupation, there's no doubt of that. We burn through workers like an Outcast through cardamine. Ah, well, what I mean to say is, our workers rotate back out to their homes frequently. While here, they are well paid and well treated, I assure you. Let me offer you a drink. | Planet Gran Canaria | Many Bounty Hunters come to this system. It's what we call a target-rich environment. You've got Corsairs, Mollies, Hessians...Even the occasional Gaian that tries to take a vacation down here. Well, the last one that came went for an extended stay on Newgate instead, and the sum I got for it netted me a month's vacation myself. Heh.Hunting Corsairs? No, I'm tracking someone else. My brother to be exact. The lad left Bretonia two weeks ago with the idea of chasing a high-value mark. Last I heared he was headed to Omega-48, but I haven't heared from him since. If the Corsairs already got him, he's a goner, that's for sure.I'm just getting my ship serviced and refuled, after that I'm off to Dublin. After having survived the Omega borderworlds for the past two months, a bit of time in good old Dub is going to be a nice, relaxing change of pace. There's plenty of Corsairs and Mollies out there to make a living as a Hunter.There's a jump hole in the east of this system, which leads to Omega-48. I haven't gone there yet, but I'll head out to find it soon. There's a ton of Corsairs and Hessians down there, along with a few of their bases, so there'll be plenty of marks to collect on. I'll have to be cautious though, I heard tale of entire fleets slugging it out down there. Wouldn't want to get caught in between. | Planet Pygar | Congratulations, you're one of the first people here who's not too fine to talk to me. Folks around here really do make you feel right at home, no? Oh well, just making sure there is nothing suspicious going on here. Pygar's pretty close to Crete and we'd rather not have a little 'incident' here. That guy over there, though. No, the one with the Order uniform. I swear he's up to something. Can't trust those people, acting all secret. | Planet New London, Landing Site | I dont know what you are thinking, but it is not what you think.I would very much like to kill everyone in this bar. Why? Nobody gets along, not for long anyway. If criminals like us spent less time killing eachother fighting over scraps, we might have a chance against the big boys.On one hand I am sad this planet did not burn, on the other hand I am glad for a place to sell my stolen goods. | Planet Crete | The supplies we use to run our bases are either stolen or purchased with the money we make from selling stolen goods. The Construction Machinery here is almost all stolen.The proximity of our base Cadiz to the Trade Lanes and Bretonian space makes it a primary source of stolen goods for the Corsairs. H-Fuel, Pharmaceuticals, and Polymers are frequently shipped here from that base.We traveled to Sirius on a sleeper ship like everyone else. Our ship, theHispania, fell victim to sabotage en route. We were forced to abandon her and make our way through the void. We found this planet with barely enough supplies to feed half of us. Few crops would grow in these infertile sands, and our numbers dwindled to almost nothing.The Malvada Nube serves as the key adult initiation ritual within the close families of the Corsairs. Young pilots must fly a stripped ship into the cloud, find an Artifact, and return safely to Crete. Almost 30% never return. The radiation levels are high, and it is rumored that there are strange beings that guard the best areas. By tradition, a lost trainee's ship and body are never recovered, just left as a reminder to future generations of failure's cost.Many think our rites of initiation are barbaric, but we can't feed, clothe, and train every Corsair born. The initiation keeps our population problems in check. At the age of sixteen every Corsair must fly into the radioactive Malvadas Cloud in an unshielded ship and return with an Artifact. Some return as they left, others become sterile, and the rest die.There were Artifacts all over Crete at one time. Most of those have been sold now, but we still find Artifacts in the Malvadas and Napo Clouds. Any Corsair could have many of the alien trinkets, but they have no function and are therefore meaningless, except for trade. Let some other fool spend his money on them.If you hear of any rumors of slavery within the Empire, be sure to bring it to my investigators' attention. We will track them down and get to the bottom of the matter, I assure you. I believe all such rumors to be paranoid chatter or Hessian inspired lies, but it is my duty to pursue them all until the purity of the Corsair way of life is evident to all of Sirius.The Artifacts we trade in Yanagi more than pay for the Side Arms, Consumer Goods, and Fertilizers that we bring to this base on our return.The Corsairs are consolidated into family lines that are brought together and strengthened by marriage. Our society is a closed one; we do not wish to dilute our blood with the seeds of weaker men. It is possible to fly with the Corsairs and to be trusted by us, but an outsider will never marry into the families of Crete.There is a legend that a secret Jump Hole lies at the center of the Graveyard of the Innocents in the Malvada Cloud. A young Corsair completing his adulthood initiation rites stumbled across it while trying to find his Artifact. He entered it and emerged in an uncharted system. Strange alien ships soon appeared in the distance, and he fled for his life back to known territory. Few people believe the story.The second year after planetfall we ran out of Food. The family leaders gathered together and decided upon a course of action. The Ventru line was chosen, and they gave themselves up to be butchered. Every Corsair is a Ventru, though the line no longer lives, they are a part of us all.Hola, Senor. Do you have any information about slavery within the Empire? My team of investigators is ready to take your statement, if you do. We will not tolerate this loathsome practice that has been so heinously promoted by the Outcasts. Those drug abusing degenerates think nothing of exploiting the vulnerable in their quest for cheap cardamine and domination over their peaceful neighbors.The Zoners at Freeport 5 and Freeport 9 have access to many of the supplies we use at this base. In exchange for the Oxygen and Water we have in abundance here we are able to get all manner of goods.Corsairs have the purest hearts and are the most fair minded citizens in all of Sirius, I declare! We shall crush the despicable slave trade and its wicked promoters wherever we find them. I have heard far too many rumors of this practice existing at remote Corsair installations. Personally, I do not believe them. The Etna Six were an aberration brought on by extended exposure to Outcasts within the Etna battle zone. Such greed and casual disregard for humanity is totally foreign to the average Corsair.The Artifacts that end up in Manhattan usually pass through Bretonia's market first. We export Alien Artifacts to the Junker base Trafalgar. I don't suppose there would be anything to stop you from doing the same.The first outsider accepted by the Corsairs was a freelancer named John Bown. He fought several of our best pilots when he entered the system, so he was able to pass. He left with a cargo bay full of Artifacts, and that is when trade began. Our economy flourished, allowing us to feed more of our people. | Tripoli Shipyard | Cadiz is an important base for the Corsairs. It is one of our primary supply depots from which we receive many Commodities.Now that our shipyard is operational, we have begun gathering the components to build a biodome. If we could have one of those domes under direct control of the Corsairs, none of us would ever want again. It would be a new age, a time without hunger. Even now we come closer and closer to it.The MOX that powers this base's larger ships is stolen, usually by our raiders that go into Bretonia. The police there are no threat to our pilots.We get many different goods and basic supplies from the Freeports in nearby zones. Often times it is easier to buy what we need with Artifact income than to steal it.Engine Components, Construction Machinery, and Gold are Commodities that are crucial to our ship-building operations here. They are either stolen or purchased from Trafalgar and shipped here.I don't know why so many resources are going into the construction of capital ships. I mean, they look imposing on the battlefield, but they're so inefficient. They are also cumbersome, and have high crew requirements. That crew could all be flying fighters and bombers instead, which are much more useful in a system like Omega-5.IMG prospectors have been sneaking into the system recently, looking for Artifacts. They don't understand whose space they are entering, until we catch them. Then their last few moments are spent thinking deeply about the subject. The Artifact trade is our resource; anyone who endangers it must be killed.Within the Malvadas Cloud you'll find a Jump Hole leading to Omicron Theta. There is another Jump Hole in this system in the Walker Cloud. Be careful, there are mines scattered among the carbon asteroids, but once past those you'll come upon the Jump Hole to Omega-41.The warships under construction here will cement our reputation as the most fearsome group in all of Sirius. They will allow us to finally break through the defences of the weakening houses, and claim their territory as our own. I can't wait until I can walk on the surface of planet Cambridge. When that day comes, it will all be thanks to these ships.The war with the Red Hessians in Omega-5 has cost the Corsairs many ships and pilots. Death is the way of the Corsair, so the lost pilots are regrettable yet acceptable. Much worse is the loss of their ships, which are often passed from one generation to the next. This shipyard is constantly running at full operational capacity to build new fighters for the front.As the number of captured ships grew, we realized that a shipyard was needed to repair damaged vessels and build ships from stolen components and spare parts. We began to gather modules together and steal the goods necessary for the construction of this shipyard, which you can see is quite operational.Newport supplies us with several essential Commodities. We get a majority of our Optronics, Side Arms, and Basic Alloys from that base.In 450 AS we captured our first ship. It was the Rheinland exploration vesselSchiller. Once we dispatched the crew the ship was ours, and more inner colony ships began to disappear. The Corsairs had begun a legacy that lasts to this day. We are pirates; we take what we need.The Corsairs and Outcasts are the survivors of theHispania. Half of the crew left in smaller ships and crawled into Sirius; they became the Corsairs. The rest of theHispaniacrew kept the ship running until it limped close enough to Sirius to abandon; they became the Outcasts. More than fifty percent of both groups died in the first two years after planetfall. | Battlecruiser Santander | I saw a Molly clip the wings off one of my pack when we were out on patrol. Bastard had the audacity to mount one of our turrets. It's good to know they like trophies, I think I'll start taking a few to teach them respect.My brethren disagree with me, but destroying the Hood was a mistake. Yes, the Guild were more favorable to the Mollys than us, but it would have at least given us extra power at the bargaining table with the Junkers of Trafalgar. Without this crucial alternative, we're being fleeced for more than we have, this isn't sustainable. And if the Mollys, by some miracle, drag this on for long enough - we will have to withdraw.These so-called Mollys have done us a service. They've driven the Armed Forces out of the system and ripened it for us to rule. The only problem is that our supply chain is.. tenuous at best. If we weren't so inhibited it would be a simple chore to flatten these would-be separatists and send Correos full of gold back to Crete. | Battleship Athos | This ship takes five days to complete a full patrol before coming back to the C6 Platform. We'll be launching again tomorrow once the engines are refuelled and the crew assignments are sorted.I wish I was back at Thira Colony with my family. Still, I know I'm protecting them by being here, with the rest of the crew, defending the system from whatever is out there.See that green cloud? That's what we're here for, I think. Whatever attacked those scouts afew years back, I reckon it came from in there. | Battlecruiser Penitence | I came here with supplies recently, figured the herculean effort this ship is undertaking would make ammo and parts necessary.Me and my wing have actually witnessed the destruction of Bautzen and the following battle. Much to Manuel's dismay, we kept our distance, no reason to interfere with our enemies killing each other, si?Our enemies have grown complacent, feeling rest assured that our recent shortcomings would extend into the future. Complacency kills, we'll show them how.We have a golden opportunity to take over the system, now that the Military and Hessians bled each other dry, but between sending supplies to the Santander and having to keep Zoners in Theta pacified, head honchos can't send us all the men we need. Blast it all.Being part of this ship's raiding party is a big honour. You have to be a shining example of what it truly means to be a Corsair to even be considered, they won't accept anything less.This ship has a lot of weight riding on it, first of her class means she'll set a legacy for years to come. It's a legacy we'll labour to be worthy of, I can promise you that much.Me and my wing have actually witnessed the destruction of Bautzen by pure chance. Much to Manuel's dismay, we kept our distance, no reason to interfere with our enemies killing each other, si?The charge this ship is spearheading is a rude awakening to everyone delusional enough to think they're safe from us. If you're here now, then I suppose that means you're smart enough not to mess with us. Keep it that way.Some say we're too tough when it comes to standards. Tell me that again when you're outnumbered two to one and your only saving grace is discipline.We have a golden opportunity to take over the system, now that the Military and Hessians bled each other dry, but between sending supplies to the stranded Santander and having to keep Zoners in Theta pacified, head honchos won't send us the men we need. Blast it all.I got assigned to the raiding detachment aboard this ship, seen plenty of action since we settled in to give Rheinland a bloody nose. But I'm more eager to put the squeeze on those Hessians when we get the chance, have to teach them where they stand. | Evia Research Complex | This research station contains the most advanced research equipment that the Corsair nation has available to it. Unfortunately, most Corsairs aren't allowed on to this installation due to the strict security rules. It might be unfair, but it helps to keep the trigger-happy teenagers away from the delicate process of xenoarcheology.I work as one of the warehouse managers here on Evia. You wouldn't believe how fast we can get through a full stockpile of Xeno Relics. It's my job to make sure that we never run out of resources with which the reserch here is conducted. It's a hard job, and I blame the Core.The Thales anomaly is a sight to behold isn't it? Have to wonder what the true purpose of it is, and what secrets lie within.The edibles we get from the scientists on Crete are some of the best tasting I've ever had. I'm no connoisseur of food, but I've rarely felt as full before as I have now. My friends keep telling me how lucky I am to get a contract as a construction worker here. I completely agree.My relatives are all soldiers serving on Leon or Cadiz. In one sense, I'm lucky to have a comfortable job researching Artifacts and observing the Thales anomaly, but I sometimes long for combat on the front lines. Maybe the grass is always greener on the other side. I might make a trip up there, once I save enough credits to buy a better ship from Tripoli.I’ve been a bartender and cook here for almost 20 years. I used to be on the front lines, raiding and pirating convoys in the Sigmas, until a Bounty Hunter nearly took my life. That’s when I said, 'Screw it - this kind of life will only land me in an early grave.' Here, I have a warm room, good food, freedom, and the constant thrill of my friends uncovering something new - whether it’s through Xeno Relics, the Thales Anomaly, or traditional Artifacts. I think I’ll stay on Evia as long as my health allows. | Battleship Delos | Freeport 9 occupation seemed like a great idea at first, but those Outcasts sure are trying to change our minds. At least we don't need to worry about the Bounty Hunters Guild nearly as much as we used to.Fes may have been a relic compared to the newer ships, but it was still a symbol of the Empire's might. Its crew fought to the last man, and so will Delos, should it come to that.We're keeping at least thirty-percent of our fighters on emergency alert, ready to deploy within 2 minutes, and another thirty on high alert, deployable within 5 minutes. These cardamine-addicts strike quick and hard, we need to be able to respond on a moment's notice. | Petra Base | Most Rogues enjoy a good brawl, but things often get messy. After the last brawl in the bar, I was in Medical for weeks with three busted ribs. Three ribs from one punch! Thank God he wasn't using his knife...There's only two kinds of Rogues that really scare me: Ones short on booze, and ones short on Cardi. Then there's the lot returning from a stay on Sugarland. Those can be unstable and best avoided completely.Rogues got us shipping all sorts of stuff down to Fort McMurray ya? No idea why, but y'know, they pay good money. Mostly. Reckon they got something big going down.So there we were minding our own business in the bar, when this giant monster of a bloke walks up and tells us we're sitting in his chair. We point out it's a Junker base, so it's our bloody chair and he says "Yeah, but it's our system, and if you don't shift I'll rip out your damn spines." That point we realised who he was. We moved.I don't mind Rogues dropping by now and again, but that last one... I thought he was about to rip Martin in half! I think we've got an understanding now, though. We don't get in their way, and they make sure most of their unneeded cargo comes our way.Rogues round these parts are a different breed to the ones you find elsewhere. These poor buggers got the bosses breathing down their necks the whole time. Makes em scared and scared Rogues are scary Rogues. They'll cut you soon as look you. Just in case that's what the boss wants. Makes living here kinda erratic. | Battleship Prox | These new crew members are really difficult to teach. I was proficient at sharing my knowledge of operating all the previous warships' the interior systems, but applying that knowledge to future Tribunus personnel is a whole different challenge. They're using technology I've never seen before - and I’ve been in this business for a long time. I suppose I’ll get used to it eventually, but it feels like I’m learning the trade all over again.My friends and I train various rookie capital ship crews here on Prox. It feels good to be among the best, especially in times when many don’t make it to their later years. We get plenty of perks for the job - first pick of the food, clean places to relax. The only real drawback is keeping any information about Prox a secret. But for benefits like this, I wouldn’t tell a soul.I love the Prox. It stands as a magnificent display of strength and serves as an excellent education center. Who cares if it can't leave Gamma? It never needs to. I'll be a happy man retiring here. |

| This is the last stop for us on our Artifact run from our homeland. Maybe one day you could run Artifacts for the Corsairs. It's dangerous but pays very well. If those aren't two things that interest you then I'm wasting my time talking to you. Just make sure to stay clear of those Red Hessians.Bretonia offers many tempting targets. We soon realized that we didn't need to buy the Gold from the Junkers; we could go steal it ourselves from the Mollys and IMG. Once we dispose of the Mollys, the Bretonian underworld will be ours - the Gaians aren't a threat to our presence here.You could run reinforcement supplies to our base in Cadiz if you want to gain favor with the Corsairs. We need H-Fuel and Engine Components there to continue fighting the Red Hessians in Omega-5. The easiest way to get there is to use a jump hole in Cambridge. That is how we get into Bretonia too.There are Outcasts on this base. They arrived in Sirius on the same ship as us - the Hispania, but they refused to join us on Crete. Now they are just like everyone else - targets. It's not that we don't like them, but that won't stop us from taking one of their shipments or putting them in the airlock. Somehow I doubt those masks they wear would save them from that.Once we drop our Artifacts here, the fun begins. We raid the Trade Lanes here in Bretonia to supply our bases back home along the Edge Worlds. Before we discovered that we could make such a nice profit from selling the Artifacts, we lived solely by raiding. Bretonia is a relatively easy place to raid, compared to Rheinland or the Sigmas. The police here are not very skilled fighters, and the military are too preoccupied with a war. The only worthy opponents here are a few Bounty Hunters.Now that there has been a ban declared on Artifacts, it has been more difficult to sell as many as before, but we have compensated by raising the prices. Everyone always wants what they can't have, and now the rich fools who crave these toys will pay almost any amount for them. We drop them off here and have the Junkers handle the last leg.The Trujillo stumbled into a gas pocket in the old Somerset mining area during the early days of Corsair incursion in the New London system. The ship was lost deep inside the hazard area. Several attempts were made to rescue the Artifacts it carried, but to no avail. |
| Halifax Freeport |
| Corsairs who venture out toward Bretonia never expect to come across an Outcast, and this is probably one of only places you could meet one. Unfortunately I have had the displeasure of meeting several, and were it not for all the other patrons here, they would leave with more than just a few bruises.The sorts that run this base don't take kindly to gunfights breaking out, but they're happy to entertain a fistfight when tensions boil over.Nearly every face I see in this bar fills me with a certain disgust... but there are few other places around to dock up and relax, so I suppose my blaster will stay holstered for now. |
| Freeport 1 |
| Avoiding the attention of the Corsairs involves trading them the goods they need. It's like a bribe we get paid for. The problem has been Bretonia moving into the area in force. With the BPA patrolling heavily, we're having to be much more careful with the few trade ships we send to Freeport 1. We try to make sure we're either not seen, or use unmarked freighters.If you pick up food here, you can take it to Cadiz in Omega 5 - just don't get caught by Hessians. If you feel like taking the risk, there's also the longer trip to Planet Crete, the mysterious Corsair home world. Make sure you've got a Corsair to escort you in though - they've got a habit of killing unannounced visitors.I've heard that an interested party in Omega 3 is paying the Corsairs to target certain Bretonian developments. Some drunk Corsairs were discussing it on Cadiz - I don't think they knew I could hear. I'll have to keep my ear to the ground to find out more. |
| Cadiz Base |
| This system is a war zone between Corsairs and Hessians. Thousands have died in the conflict. You'll find debris strewn throughout the system from destroyed ships lost to both sides. The fighting has come to a bloody stalemate, with each side looking for the one last push to topple the other's hold.Omega-5 is the site of a full scale war between the Corsairs and Hessians. The two factions are vying for control of this critical Jump Hole crossroads in the Omega Sector. Within the area of the no-man's-land and the Hammen Hole are numerous dead ships from both sides. Most are picked clean, but there are some that may still yield some weapons.Artifacts that come to this base are brought from throughout Corsair space. This is the last stop before entering House space, so everyone rests, refuels, and enjoys a little brotherhood before making a dash through the BAF patrols. From here the Artifacts will be shipped to Trafalgar where the Junkers will fence them to the rest of Sirius.The Side Arms you see the Corsairs carrying at this base came from Leon. You can make money on this run. And you can always pick up a piece for yourself if you have need of a better one.Omega-5 is the hub for all travel in this part of the Border Worlds. In this system you will find five Jump Holes that lead to Omega-3, Omega-7, Cambridge, Omega-11, and Omega-41. That's why it is so important we hold this system as Corsair space.The Jump Hole to Omega-41 will take you one step closer to our home system of Omicron Gamma. There you will come upon our shipyard, Tripoli, and our home world the beloved Crete, from which the Corsairs found a place to grab onto and live.Many of the supplies that keep Cadiz running come from the Junkers of Trafalgar in Bretonia. Not only do we get basics, we also ship Engine Components here.The Light Arms we manage to loot from passing transports in Cambridge and Omega 3 get sent on to Skiros and Crete.This is the Corsair forward sector. From here we organize raiding parties that venture into Cambridge and New London to resupply our bases with stolen goods. Power is something that is taken, and we have the power to take what we wish, especially in New London. The police force there is laughable.The Omega-3 Trade Lanes are a tempting target for our raiders. That space is filled with Hessians, and the Jump Hole is an ambush point for the Hessians. But once they arrive in Omega-3, goods-laden ships traveling the Lanes between Rheinland and Bretonia are easy pickings. |
| Lagos Depot |
| I miss the old brawls with some of the Outcasts on Yanagi. Sure, their Cardamine mutations give them greater stamina and quicker healing, but that just means you have to punch them a bit harder. More fun that way. Maybe I'll run down to Freeport 9 and see if I can find some trouble there.Welcome to our little corner of hell. When the GMG decided to force the Junkers out, probably to try and cut off our route to Rheinland, we were forced to make other arrangements. We built this base to keep the Artifact routes open, but it's also a convenient place to launch a raid on the Trade Lanes from.I just came from Crete with a cargo of Artifacts. I make this run often enough, and it can be a dull one. Sometimes I'll continue on a bit further into Rheinland, but most of the time we'll offload our Artifacts and let the Unioners, Junkers and Hogosha take it from here. Then I'll join up with a couple of our raiders and go fishing in this blue sea for cargo to take back home.Lagos may not be the most elegant piece of work, but it suits our needs. From here, we have an alternate way to trade Artifacts with the Hogosha, who can take them to Kusari and beyond. We also trade with the Unioners, who can take them into and through Rheinland, without the constant Hessian harassment in Omegas. Of course, there is the GMG to deal with here instead.I fly sorties to the Trade Lane on occasion when some of our boys need fresh cargo for the yards back home. I like this region of Sirius. No open stretches of space where you can get tagged. All you have to do here is fight off the occasional scout, or break away and slip into the endless cloud if things start to get a bit too hot.The Hogosha are our strongest ally, and they handle most, if not all, of our Kusari interests. They have considerable leeway to move Artifacts through Kusari space, which is good for us. I hear they even take them as far as Liberty. They have an understanding with Samura, so we avoid hitting Samura transports as often. Every once in a while we mock-raid one to keep up appearances. Kishiro and GMG ships are prey, like the rest.There are several groups with an interest in this region. The GMG lay claim to this space and run frequent patrols, mostly around the Trade Lanes and their Gas Mining platforms. The Hogosha, Unioners and Junkers come here to buy artifacts. Recently, the Outcasts have also become more numerous in the region, probably peddling their drugs to Rheinland and Kusari. The Golden Chrysantemums are sometimes seen with them. Last, there's the Blood Dragons who seem to enjoy a good brawl. No shortage of foes in this space, but that is nothing new to a Corsair.There's a Hole from Sigma-17 into this area not far from the base. The route back to Crete goes through there, and Omicron Theta. The Gas Miners have patrols throughout the area, and Bounty Hunters also prowl about, but overall it's not that hard to reach home from here.We get the odd Zoners in here. They prefer to stay out of the house systems. Usually they're just picking up Light Arms and Consumer Goods for their Freeport out there in Omicron Theta. They'll trade those for Food and other basics, so we don't need to haul those ourselves as much. That lot likes living on the ragged edge, and you'll find it in the Omicron systems.We've reached some understandings with the Unioners of late. We'll see how that goes, I'm not wholly trustful of any Rheinlander. Least of all those who are known to deal in Hessian Tears. Still, if they want to profit from the Artifact trade, let them. Another route into Liberty for those doesn't hurt us.The Crow nebula has its own dangers. Omicron space has a lot of radiation, but here, it are explosive pockets of gas that are the greatest risk. With a bit of practise, you can spot and avoid them though. If you plan on raiding here, it's smart to do so. Transports sometimes try to flee into those regions. |
| Luxury Liner Hawaii |
| We sell the Artifacts directly to the Hogosha. There was a time when we went through the GMG, but it is always more profitable to cut out the middleman. That has annoyed those Gas Miners a lot, but that's not my problem. I brought my Artifacts from Alcudia, in Omicron Lambda.I passed out drunk at the observation deck bar a few nights ago - too many of those deadly Omnistellar Gullet Blasters I guess. While I was out someone stole my knife, probably some dirty tourist looking for a souvenir. Whoever took that knife is dead; it has been in my family for six generations.The Alien Artifacts we sell to the Hogosha here come mostly from Crete, but they can be found on a lot of planetary fragments and asteroids as well. We don't know how they got there, and frankly, don't care. These trinkets have no value to us, but they are worth their weight in gold in the houses. You could make a fortune picking up a full load at cost from Crete, then delivering them to any of the Houses. We won't stop you if you want to do that. |
| Leon Base |
| We get some of our basic supplies from the Zoner bases in the area. If it doesn't come from the Freeports, we get it from Yanagi. Any surplus we get, such as Rheinland Side Arms or Artifacts, is sent to Cadiz.This base trades in Commodities almost exclusively with other Corsair bases. The less we have to deal with outsiders the better. We get our Water and Oxygen from Crete, so this base is almost entirely free from foreign trade. The Zoners are an unwanted presence here, but we tolerate them for now.Some Zoner at Freeport 5 tried to run away with a Corsair woman. Her family is a laughing stock and will be so until her kin has killed the interloper. Her brother has gone to Hawaii to sell Artifacts; when he returns he will hunt down the fool Zoner.This base was established to secure the supply lines that lead from our homeworld to Cadiz in Omega-5. It also protects our shipments arriving from Bretonia and the Trade Lanes along the southwestern Edge Worlds. This space is the body of Corsair space. Proceed further and you will touch upon its heart.Hessians come in from Omega-11 and run attack raids on Corsairs traveling through this system. We lash back with attacks on Diamond shipments in Omega-11. The problem with the Hessians is not that they are skilled or courageous, but their numbers; kill three and five more will replace them.The Jump Holes in this system will lead you throughout southern Sirius: Omicron Gamma is to the east, Omicron Theta is north of the Freeport, Omega-5 is west of here, and Omega-11 lies to the north of this base. I tell you this because you have made yourself useful to us. Should that ever change, I will be one among many whom you will have to watch for.If you ever cheat a Corsair, there is a special punishment that will befall you. Do you know what it is to be marooned? We'll take you to a deserted chunk of rock in the middle of nowhere and leave you there. Death comes slowly in a vac-suit.I've come up against Outcasts in Sigma-19 before. They are very good at killing, as are we. Yes, even though they have greater numbers, I prefer to fight Red Hessians. I may not be afraid of death, but I don't go looking for it, either.Most zoners refuse to trade with us now because of Freeport 9, and our Pharmaceuticals stockpile is slowly running low. We're resorting to hiring Freelancers to run them from Atka.This place is mostly a rest spot for Zoners and Corsairs as they travel along the Edge Worlds. Others land here, but they have to respect our ways. Don't stay here too long or else we begin to notice that an outsider is walking a Corsair base. Once that happens you use the airlock to leave.Two of our garrison wings were redeployed to reinforce the Delos in Theta. I wish I'd get sent there as well, there is no glory to be gained here on this irradiated rock. |
| Freeport 5 |
| Every firstborn Corsair carries the family's ancestral blade. The knife is a symbol of our struggle to live and the solidarity of each line. The blades are made from the remnants of the first ship that landed on Crete.The shipyard Tripoli requires many different Commodities to maintain production of our vessels and raiding crafts. We ship Polymers and Engine Components there from this base.We bring Artifacts to this base from Crete. It is not as lucrative a run as others, but the Zoners will find buyers for them. Either way we make our money.One of the Zoners here at this base fell in love with my daughter. When she told me of her love I sent her back to Crete. She can never return here. My son has gone looking for the man who dishonored my family.Soon I will be headed to Omega-5 to fight the Red Hessians in that part of Sirius, where it is vital that we gain control. It is every Corsair's responsibility to fly a tour of duty in the Hessian War.People often wonder how Corsairs can have such excellent ships when they are all pieced together from other stolen and salvaged vessels. Corsairs are masters of making something from nothing, and we have an advantage. Not all Artifacts are useless; many we recovered offered insight into the science of ship building.Do you know what it means when I tell you that I am a Ventru? I doubt you would understand my full meaning. Travel deeper into our worlds and perhaps then the horrible truth will make itself clear to you.The Bounty Hunters at this base are fools. Granted, we cannot attack them while they are here, but most of them will soon find themselves in Corsair ambushes when they have left the no-fighting zone that surrounds this place.One day the Corsairs may destroy this base if we find we have no more need of it. The Zoners do not realize what kind of people we are. Death is so familiar to a Corsair that delivering it is second nature. It would trouble no Corsair to put every Zoner at this base to the sword. |

| If you find yourself in Rheinland anytime soon, be sure to get your hands on any Fertilizer you can. Head honchos said we need all we can get to keep the Biodomes running properly, and we're ready to pay handsomely for it, regardless of how you got them.During the takeover, some of the Bounty Hunters managed to seal themselves off in a storage room. We just cut off oxygen and they promptly opened the doors only to be gunned down. Should have seen their faces, ha!Those pesky Zoners were graciously allowed to stay, as long as they continue to work for the benefit of Crete. If you ask me, I'd just space them all but orders are orders. |
| Ciutadella Outpost |
| The MOX that powers this base's larger ships is stolen, usually by our raiders that go into Bretonia. The police there are no threat to our pilots.Those bloody corporate lapdogs took over Gammu while we were forced to just watch, and because of the AI deployed minefields, we can't even attack them effectively. For now, we're just harassing their convoys with fighter wings. If all goes well, they'll just starve to death.We kept requesting reinforcements from Crete but there were just none to send our way. Those Core bastards must have waited until we were too busy elsewhere to pull this off.As the number of captured ships grew, we realized that a shipyard was needed to repair damaged vessels and build ships from stolen components and spare parts. We began to gather modules together and steal the goods necessary for the construction of this shipyard, which you can see is quite operational.Gammu treasures belong to Crete by birthright! Core has no business being here and we'll see to it that they don't stay here for long, mark my words! |
| Casablanca Base |
| Rheinland beer isn't that bad really. Myself, I like my tequila better, but we don't get much of that out here and the Hessians left barrels of their stuff behind. Want a beer?Rabat is quite the planet to have this base orbit around. A lot of gases to be mined and used for new weapons or fuel or whatever. Seems like the Hessians just ignored it though, the whole gas mining section was stripped out by them and who knows what they did with it. And to top it all off they caused some structural damage while leaving too. I doubt we'll be mining anything here any time soon.I still can't believe we managed to retake this base. Those Hessian dogs put up some fight. I heard stories a bunch of them got cut off from their escape ships in the engineering section when we landed here, so they locked themselves tight and kept messing around with the station power systems until a bunch of us cut through all the doors a few days later and finally cleaned them out. They are like rats, but big scary ones.We have a colony on the surface of Planet Gran Canaria. A lot of people on Crete look down on those settlers, claiming its not the Corsair way... Myself, I'm worried that without those farms, this base is going to have a harder time supporting us.I'd like to think we've gotten rid of the Hessians in this system. Fat chance. Already my hermanos are coming down with rumours that they got a new operation up north. They keep flooding through that damned jump hole in the nebula cloud next to Tangier, wish we could just close that hole for good.A Bounty Hunter jumped me near the Omega 47 hole in Omega 49 earlier this week. I fought the bastard off, but right after I was done with him a Hessian appeared. My ship was nearly out of supplies by then, so I had a tough fight. I managed to get clear and withdraw to Omega 47, but sustained heavy damage. Right now I'm grounded until my ship is fixed, but once it is, I'm going to pay that Hessian a visit. He will regret having crossed me.This base is ours... for now. Rumour already has it a Hessian counter offensive is on its way. We're a long way from home, hopefully the fleet will get here in time if those Hessians really do try to take this base back. |

| The Corsairs and Outcasts are the survivors of theHispania. Half of the crew left in smaller ships and crawled into Sirius; they became the Corsairs. The rest of theHispaniacrew kept the ship running until it limped close enough to Sirius to abandon; they became the Outcasts. More than fifty percent of both groups died in the first two years after planetfall.We bring a lot of Dublin gold and Cambridge food through this route all the way to Crete. This is why this jump hole is so well defended: we can't let our enemies disrupt this lifeline. This ship is what makes it all possible.We get many different goods and basic supplies from the Freeports in nearby zones. Often times it is easier to buy what we need with Artifact income than to steal it.This battleship is the only thing that protects this nebula cloud from being overrun by the Red Hessians. It's originally designed by the Order, so it's stealthy enough to move within the cloud undetected and beat the Hessians at their own game. They have tried to destroy it by organised assault more times than I can count, but they keep failing because of the cloud density and this ship's stealth mode.Alright, Senor. I'll admit that not all of our munitions workers are here voluntarily. But those are mainly criminals of the worst sort who are paying their debt to the Empire by building munitions to defeat our enemies. Or, some of them are Hessian dogs or Mollys, that is why you see some of them arriving in shackles. I love the irony of that: they must now labor to build the munitions that will defeat their compatriots!Within the Malvadas Cloud you'll find a Jump Hole leading to Omicron Theta. There is another Jump Hole in this system in the Walker Cloud. Be careful, there are mines scattered among the carbon asteroids, but once past those you'll come upon the Jump Hole to Omega-41.The war with the Red Hessians in Omega-5 has cost the Corsairs many ships and pilots. Death is the way of the Corsair, so the lost pilots are regrettable yet acceptable. Much worse is the loss of their ships, which are often passed from one generation to the next. This shipyard is constantly running at full operational capacity to build new fighters for the front.Slavery? How can you say such things, Senor? Slavery is not only illegal within the Empire, it is a terrible and wicked crime. You must not repeat such accusations. If those words reach the wrong ears it could mean great trouble for us here. Not that have done anything wrong, but you know what bureaucratic investigations are like. We have production deadlines to meet here. The Outcasts are the slavers, not noble and honorable Corsairs. Forced prison labor is not slavery. It is justice and a righteous penance for their offenses.In 450 AS we captured our first ship. It was the Rheinland exploration vesselSchiller. Once we dispatched the crew the ship was ours, and more inner colony ships began to disappear. The Corsairs had begun a legacy that lasts to this day. We are pirates; we take what we need.Hola, Senor. Are you by chance the pilot of the transport that just delivered our newest contingent of, ah, shall we say, workers? Munitions manufacturing is a dangerous and exhausting occupation, there's no doubt of that. We burn through workers like an Outcast through cardamine. Ah, well, what I mean to say is, our workers rotate back out to their homes frequently. While here, they are well paid and well treated, I assure you. Let me offer you a drink. |
| Planet Gran Canaria |
| Many Bounty Hunters come to this system. It's what we call a target-rich environment. You've got Corsairs, Mollies, Hessians...Even the occasional Gaian that tries to take a vacation down here. Well, the last one that came went for an extended stay on Newgate instead, and the sum I got for it netted me a month's vacation myself. Heh.Hunting Corsairs? No, I'm tracking someone else. My brother to be exact. The lad left Bretonia two weeks ago with the idea of chasing a high-value mark. Last I heared he was headed to Omega-48, but I haven't heared from him since. If the Corsairs already got him, he's a goner, that's for sure.I'm just getting my ship serviced and refuled, after that I'm off to Dublin. After having survived the Omega borderworlds for the past two months, a bit of time in good old Dub is going to be a nice, relaxing change of pace. There's plenty of Corsairs and Mollies out there to make a living as a Hunter.There's a jump hole in the east of this system, which leads to Omega-48. I haven't gone there yet, but I'll head out to find it soon. There's a ton of Corsairs and Hessians down there, along with a few of their bases, so there'll be plenty of marks to collect on. I'll have to be cautious though, I heard tale of entire fleets slugging it out down there. Wouldn't want to get caught in between. |
| Planet Pygar |
| Congratulations, you're one of the first people here who's not too fine to talk to me. Folks around here really do make you feel right at home, no? Oh well, just making sure there is nothing suspicious going on here. Pygar's pretty close to Crete and we'd rather not have a little 'incident' here. That guy over there, though. No, the one with the Order uniform. I swear he's up to something. Can't trust those people, acting all secret. |
| Planet New London, Landing Site |
| I dont know what you are thinking, but it is not what you think.I would very much like to kill everyone in this bar. Why? Nobody gets along, not for long anyway. If criminals like us spent less time killing eachother fighting over scraps, we might have a chance against the big boys.On one hand I am sad this planet did not burn, on the other hand I am glad for a place to sell my stolen goods. |
| Planet Crete |
| The supplies we use to run our bases are either stolen or purchased with the money we make from selling stolen goods. The Construction Machinery here is almost all stolen.The proximity of our base Cadiz to the Trade Lanes and Bretonian space makes it a primary source of stolen goods for the Corsairs. H-Fuel, Pharmaceuticals, and Polymers are frequently shipped here from that base.We traveled to Sirius on a sleeper ship like everyone else. Our ship, theHispania, fell victim to sabotage en route. We were forced to abandon her and make our way through the void. We found this planet with barely enough supplies to feed half of us. Few crops would grow in these infertile sands, and our numbers dwindled to almost nothing.The Malvada Nube serves as the key adult initiation ritual within the close families of the Corsairs. Young pilots must fly a stripped ship into the cloud, find an Artifact, and return safely to Crete. Almost 30% never return. The radiation levels are high, and it is rumored that there are strange beings that guard the best areas. By tradition, a lost trainee's ship and body are never recovered, just left as a reminder to future generations of failure's cost.Many think our rites of initiation are barbaric, but we can't feed, clothe, and train every Corsair born. The initiation keeps our population problems in check. At the age of sixteen every Corsair must fly into the radioactive Malvadas Cloud in an unshielded ship and return with an Artifact. Some return as they left, others become sterile, and the rest die.There were Artifacts all over Crete at one time. Most of those have been sold now, but we still find Artifacts in the Malvadas and Napo Clouds. Any Corsair could have many of the alien trinkets, but they have no function and are therefore meaningless, except for trade. Let some other fool spend his money on them.If you hear of any rumors of slavery within the Empire, be sure to bring it to my investigators' attention. We will track them down and get to the bottom of the matter, I assure you. I believe all such rumors to be paranoid chatter or Hessian inspired lies, but it is my duty to pursue them all until the purity of the Corsair way of life is evident to all of Sirius.The Artifacts we trade in Yanagi more than pay for the Side Arms, Consumer Goods, and Fertilizers that we bring to this base on our return.The Corsairs are consolidated into family lines that are brought together and strengthened by marriage. Our society is a closed one; we do not wish to dilute our blood with the seeds of weaker men. It is possible to fly with the Corsairs and to be trusted by us, but an outsider will never marry into the families of Crete.There is a legend that a secret Jump Hole lies at the center of the Graveyard of the Innocents in the Malvada Cloud. A young Corsair completing his adulthood initiation rites stumbled across it while trying to find his Artifact. He entered it and emerged in an uncharted system. Strange alien ships soon appeared in the distance, and he fled for his life back to known territory. Few people believe the story.The second year after planetfall we ran out of Food. The family leaders gathered together and decided upon a course of action. The Ventru line was chosen, and they gave themselves up to be butchered. Every Corsair is a Ventru, though the line no longer lives, they are a part of us all.Hola, Senor. Do you have any information about slavery within the Empire? My team of investigators is ready to take your statement, if you do. We will not tolerate this loathsome practice that has been so heinously promoted by the Outcasts. Those drug abusing degenerates think nothing of exploiting the vulnerable in their quest for cheap cardamine and domination over their peaceful neighbors.The Zoners at Freeport 5 and Freeport 9 have access to many of the supplies we use at this base. In exchange for the Oxygen and Water we have in abundance here we are able to get all manner of goods.Corsairs have the purest hearts and are the most fair minded citizens in all of Sirius, I declare! We shall crush the despicable slave trade and its wicked promoters wherever we find them. I have heard far too many rumors of this practice existing at remote Corsair installations. Personally, I do not believe them. The Etna Six were an aberration brought on by extended exposure to Outcasts within the Etna battle zone. Such greed and casual disregard for humanity is totally foreign to the average Corsair.The Artifacts that end up in Manhattan usually pass through Bretonia's market first. We export Alien Artifacts to the Junker base Trafalgar. I don't suppose there would be anything to stop you from doing the same.The first outsider accepted by the Corsairs was a freelancer named John Bown. He fought several of our best pilots when he entered the system, so he was able to pass. He left with a cargo bay full of Artifacts, and that is when trade began. Our economy flourished, allowing us to feed more of our people. |
| Tripoli Shipyard |
| Cadiz is an important base for the Corsairs. It is one of our primary supply depots from which we receive many Commodities.Now that our shipyard is operational, we have begun gathering the components to build a biodome. If we could have one of those domes under direct control of the Corsairs, none of us would ever want again. It would be a new age, a time without hunger. Even now we come closer and closer to it.The MOX that powers this base's larger ships is stolen, usually by our raiders that go into Bretonia. The police there are no threat to our pilots.We get many different goods and basic supplies from the Freeports in nearby zones. Often times it is easier to buy what we need with Artifact income than to steal it.Engine Components, Construction Machinery, and Gold are Commodities that are crucial to our ship-building operations here. They are either stolen or purchased from Trafalgar and shipped here.I don't know why so many resources are going into the construction of capital ships. I mean, they look imposing on the battlefield, but they're so inefficient. They are also cumbersome, and have high crew requirements. That crew could all be flying fighters and bombers instead, which are much more useful in a system like Omega-5.IMG prospectors have been sneaking into the system recently, looking for Artifacts. They don't understand whose space they are entering, until we catch them. Then their last few moments are spent thinking deeply about the subject. The Artifact trade is our resource; anyone who endangers it must be killed.Within the Malvadas Cloud you'll find a Jump Hole leading to Omicron Theta. There is another Jump Hole in this system in the Walker Cloud. Be careful, there are mines scattered among the carbon asteroids, but once past those you'll come upon the Jump Hole to Omega-41.The warships under construction here will cement our reputation as the most fearsome group in all of Sirius. They will allow us to finally break through the defences of the weakening houses, and claim their territory as our own. I can't wait until I can walk on the surface of planet Cambridge. When that day comes, it will all be thanks to these ships.The war with the Red Hessians in Omega-5 has cost the Corsairs many ships and pilots. Death is the way of the Corsair, so the lost pilots are regrettable yet acceptable. Much worse is the loss of their ships, which are often passed from one generation to the next. This shipyard is constantly running at full operational capacity to build new fighters for the front.As the number of captured ships grew, we realized that a shipyard was needed to repair damaged vessels and build ships from stolen components and spare parts. We began to gather modules together and steal the goods necessary for the construction of this shipyard, which you can see is quite operational.Newport supplies us with several essential Commodities. We get a majority of our Optronics, Side Arms, and Basic Alloys from that base.In 450 AS we captured our first ship. It was the Rheinland exploration vesselSchiller. Once we dispatched the crew the ship was ours, and more inner colony ships began to disappear. The Corsairs had begun a legacy that lasts to this day. We are pirates; we take what we need.The Corsairs and Outcasts are the survivors of theHispania. Half of the crew left in smaller ships and crawled into Sirius; they became the Corsairs. The rest of theHispaniacrew kept the ship running until it limped close enough to Sirius to abandon; they became the Outcasts. More than fifty percent of both groups died in the first two years after planetfall. |
| Battlecruiser Santander |
| I saw a Molly clip the wings off one of my pack when we were out on patrol. Bastard had the audacity to mount one of our turrets. It's good to know they like trophies, I think I'll start taking a few to teach them respect.My brethren disagree with me, but destroying the Hood was a mistake. Yes, the Guild were more favorable to the Mollys than us, but it would have at least given us extra power at the bargaining table with the Junkers of Trafalgar. Without this crucial alternative, we're being fleeced for more than we have, this isn't sustainable. And if the Mollys, by some miracle, drag this on for long enough - we will have to withdraw.These so-called Mollys have done us a service. They've driven the Armed Forces out of the system and ripened it for us to rule. The only problem is that our supply chain is.. tenuous at best. If we weren't so inhibited it would be a simple chore to flatten these would-be separatists and send Correos full of gold back to Crete. |
| Battleship Athos |
| This ship takes five days to complete a full patrol before coming back to the C6 Platform. We'll be launching again tomorrow once the engines are refuelled and the crew assignments are sorted.I wish I was back at Thira Colony with my family. Still, I know I'm protecting them by being here, with the rest of the crew, defending the system from whatever is out there.See that green cloud? That's what we're here for, I think. Whatever attacked those scouts afew years back, I reckon it came from in there. |
| Battlecruiser Penitence |
| I came here with supplies recently, figured the herculean effort this ship is undertaking would make ammo and parts necessary.Me and my wing have actually witnessed the destruction of Bautzen and the following battle. Much to Manuel's dismay, we kept our distance, no reason to interfere with our enemies killing each other, si?Our enemies have grown complacent, feeling rest assured that our recent shortcomings would extend into the future. Complacency kills, we'll show them how.We have a golden opportunity to take over the system, now that the Military and Hessians bled each other dry, but between sending supplies to the Santander and having to keep Zoners in Theta pacified, head honchos can't send us all the men we need. Blast it all.Being part of this ship's raiding party is a big honour. You have to be a shining example of what it truly means to be a Corsair to even be considered, they won't accept anything less.This ship has a lot of weight riding on it, first of her class means she'll set a legacy for years to come. It's a legacy we'll labour to be worthy of, I can promise you that much.Me and my wing have actually witnessed the destruction of Bautzen by pure chance. Much to Manuel's dismay, we kept our distance, no reason to interfere with our enemies killing each other, si?The charge this ship is spearheading is a rude awakening to everyone delusional enough to think they're safe from us. If you're here now, then I suppose that means you're smart enough not to mess with us. Keep it that way.Some say we're too tough when it comes to standards. Tell me that again when you're outnumbered two to one and your only saving grace is discipline.We have a golden opportunity to take over the system, now that the Military and Hessians bled each other dry, but between sending supplies to the stranded Santander and having to keep Zoners in Theta pacified, head honchos won't send us the men we need. Blast it all.I got assigned to the raiding detachment aboard this ship, seen plenty of action since we settled in to give Rheinland a bloody nose. But I'm more eager to put the squeeze on those Hessians when we get the chance, have to teach them where they stand. |
| Evia Research Complex |
| This research station contains the most advanced research equipment that the Corsair nation has available to it. Unfortunately, most Corsairs aren't allowed on to this installation due to the strict security rules. It might be unfair, but it helps to keep the trigger-happy teenagers away from the delicate process of xenoarcheology.I work as one of the warehouse managers here on Evia. You wouldn't believe how fast we can get through a full stockpile of Xeno Relics. It's my job to make sure that we never run out of resources with which the reserch here is conducted. It's a hard job, and I blame the Core.The Thales anomaly is a sight to behold isn't it? Have to wonder what the true purpose of it is, and what secrets lie within.The edibles we get from the scientists on Crete are some of the best tasting I've ever had. I'm no connoisseur of food, but I've rarely felt as full before as I have now. My friends keep telling me how lucky I am to get a contract as a construction worker here. I completely agree.My relatives are all soldiers serving on Leon or Cadiz. In one sense, I'm lucky to have a comfortable job researching Artifacts and observing the Thales anomaly, but I sometimes long for combat on the front lines. Maybe the grass is always greener on the other side. I might make a trip up there, once I save enough credits to buy a better ship from Tripoli.I’ve been a bartender and cook here for almost 20 years. I used to be on the front lines, raiding and pirating convoys in the Sigmas, until a Bounty Hunter nearly took my life. That’s when I said, 'Screw it - this kind of life will only land me in an early grave.' Here, I have a warm room, good food, freedom, and the constant thrill of my friends uncovering something new - whether it’s through Xeno Relics, the Thales Anomaly, or traditional Artifacts. I think I’ll stay on Evia as long as my health allows. |
| Battleship Delos |
| Freeport 9 occupation seemed like a great idea at first, but those Outcasts sure are trying to change our minds. At least we don't need to worry about the Bounty Hunters Guild nearly as much as we used to.Fes may have been a relic compared to the newer ships, but it was still a symbol of the Empire's might. Its crew fought to the last man, and so will Delos, should it come to that.We're keeping at least thirty-percent of our fighters on emergency alert, ready to deploy within 2 minutes, and another thirty on high alert, deployable within 5 minutes. These cardamine-addicts strike quick and hard, we need to be able to respond on a moment's notice. |
| Petra Base |
| Most Rogues enjoy a good brawl, but things often get messy. After the last brawl in the bar, I was in Medical for weeks with three busted ribs. Three ribs from one punch! Thank God he wasn't using his knife...There's only two kinds of Rogues that really scare me: Ones short on booze, and ones short on Cardi. Then there's the lot returning from a stay on Sugarland. Those can be unstable and best avoided completely.Rogues got us shipping all sorts of stuff down to Fort McMurray ya? No idea why, but y'know, they pay good money. Mostly. Reckon they got something big going down.So there we were minding our own business in the bar, when this giant monster of a bloke walks up and tells us we're sitting in his chair. We point out it's a Junker base, so it's our bloody chair and he says "Yeah, but it's our system, and if you don't shift I'll rip out your damn spines." That point we realised who he was. We moved.I don't mind Rogues dropping by now and again, but that last one... I thought he was about to rip Martin in half! I think we've got an understanding now, though. We don't get in their way, and they make sure most of their unneeded cargo comes our way.Rogues round these parts are a different breed to the ones you find elsewhere. These poor buggers got the bosses breathing down their necks the whole time. Makes em scared and scared Rogues are scary Rogues. They'll cut you soon as look you. Just in case that's what the boss wants. Makes living here kinda erratic. |
| Battleship Prox |
| These new crew members are really difficult to teach. I was proficient at sharing my knowledge of operating all the previous warships' the interior systems, but applying that knowledge to future Tribunus personnel is a whole different challenge. They're using technology I've never seen before - and I’ve been in this business for a long time. I suppose I’ll get used to it eventually, but it feels like I’m learning the trade all over again.My friends and I train various rookie capital ship crews here on Prox. It feels good to be among the best, especially in times when many don’t make it to their later years. We get plenty of perks for the job - first pick of the food, clean places to relax. The only real drawback is keeping any information about Prox a secret. But for benefits like this, I wouldn’t tell a soul.I love the Prox. It stands as a magnificent display of strength and serves as an excellent education center. Who cares if it can't leave Gamma? It never needs to. I'll be a happy man retiring here. |

| I miss the old brawls with some of the Outcasts on Yanagi. Sure, their Cardamine mutations give them greater stamina and quicker healing, but that just means you have to punch them a bit harder. More fun that way. Maybe I'll run down to Freeport 9 and see if I can find some trouble there.Welcome to our little corner of hell. When the GMG decided to force the Junkers out, probably to try and cut off our route to Rheinland, we were forced to make other arrangements. We built this base to keep the Artifact routes open, but it's also a convenient place to launch a raid on the Trade Lanes from.I just came from Crete with a cargo of Artifacts. I make this run often enough, and it can be a dull one. Sometimes I'll continue on a bit further into Rheinland, but most of the time we'll offload our Artifacts and let the Unioners, Junkers and Hogosha take it from here. Then I'll join up with a couple of our raiders and go fishing in this blue sea for cargo to take back home.Lagos may not be the most elegant piece of work, but it suits our needs. From here, we have an alternate way to trade Artifacts with the Hogosha, who can take them to Kusari and beyond. We also trade with the Unioners, who can take them into and through Rheinland, without the constant Hessian harassment in Omegas. Of course, there is the GMG to deal with here instead.I fly sorties to the Trade Lane on occasion when some of our boys need fresh cargo for the yards back home. I like this region of Sirius. No open stretches of space where you can get tagged. All you have to do here is fight off the occasional scout, or break away and slip into the endless cloud if things start to get a bit too hot.The Hogosha are our strongest ally, and they handle most, if not all, of our Kusari interests. They have considerable leeway to move Artifacts through Kusari space, which is good for us. I hear they even take them as far as Liberty. They have an understanding with Samura, so we avoid hitting Samura transports as often. Every once in a while we mock-raid one to keep up appearances. Kishiro and GMG ships are prey, like the rest.There are several groups with an interest in this region. The GMG lay claim to this space and run frequent patrols, mostly around the Trade Lanes and their Gas Mining platforms. The Hogosha, Unioners and Junkers come here to buy artifacts. Recently, the Outcasts have also become more numerous in the region, probably peddling their drugs to Rheinland and Kusari. The Golden Chrysantemums are sometimes seen with them. Last, there's the Blood Dragons who seem to enjoy a good brawl. No shortage of foes in this space, but that is nothing new to a Corsair.There's a Hole from Sigma-17 into this area not far from the base. The route back to Crete goes through there, and Omicron Theta. The Gas Miners have patrols throughout the area, and Bounty Hunters also prowl about, but overall it's not that hard to reach home from here.We get the odd Zoners in here. They prefer to stay out of the house systems. Usually they're just picking up Light Arms and Consumer Goods for their Freeport out there in Omicron Theta. They'll trade those for Food and other basics, so we don't need to haul those ourselves as much. That lot likes living on the ragged edge, and you'll find it in the Omicron systems.We've reached some understandings with the Unioners of late. We'll see how that goes, I'm not wholly trustful of any Rheinlander. Least of all those who are known to deal in Hessian Tears. Still, if they want to profit from the Artifact trade, let them. Another route into Liberty for those doesn't hurt us.The Crow nebula has its own dangers. Omicron space has a lot of radiation, but here, it are explosive pockets of gas that are the greatest risk.

- I miss the old brawls with some of the Outcasts on Yanagi. Sure, their Cardamine mutations give them greater stamina and quicker healing, but that just means you have to punch them a bit harder. More fun that way. Maybe I'll run down to Freeport 9 and see if I can find some trouble there.
- Welcome to our little corner of hell. When the GMG decided to force the Junkers out, probably to try and cut off our route to Rheinland, we were forced to make other arrangements. We built this base to keep the Artifact routes open, but it's also a convenient place to launch a raid on the Trade Lanes from.
- I just came from Crete with a cargo of Artifacts. I make this run often enough, and it can be a dull one. Sometimes I'll continue on a bit further into Rheinland, but most of the time we'll offload our Artifacts and let the Unioners, Junkers and Hogosha take it from here. Then I'll join up with a couple of our raiders and go fishing in this blue sea for cargo to take back home.
- Lagos may not be the most elegant piece of work, but it suits our needs. From here, we have an alternate way to trade Artifacts with the Hogosha, who can take them to Kusari and beyond. We also trade with the Unioners, who can take them into and through Rheinland, without the constant Hessian harassment in Omegas. Of course, there is the GMG to deal with here instead.
- I fly sorties to the Trade Lane on occasion when some of our boys need fresh cargo for the yards back home. I like this region of Sirius. No open stretches of space where you can get tagged. All you have to do here is fight off the occasional scout, or break away and slip into the endless cloud if things start to get a bit too hot.
- The Hogosha are our strongest ally, and they handle most, if not all, of our Kusari interests. They have considerable leeway to move Artifacts through Kusari space, which is good for us. I hear they even take them as far as Liberty. They have an understanding with Samura, so we avoid hitting Samura transports as often. Every once in a while we mock-raid one to keep up appearances. Kishiro and GMG ships are prey, like the rest.
- There are several groups with an interest in this region. The GMG lay claim to this space and run frequent patrols, mostly around the Trade Lanes and their Gas Mining platforms. The Hogosha, Unioners and Junkers come here to buy artifacts. Recently, the Outcasts have also become more numerous in the region, probably peddling their drugs to Rheinland and Kusari. The Golden Chrysantemums are sometimes seen with them. Last, there's the Blood Dragons who seem to enjoy a good brawl. No shortage of foes in this space, but that is nothing new to a Corsair.
- There's a Hole from Sigma-17 into this area not far from the base. The route back to Crete goes through there, and Omicron Theta. The Gas Miners have patrols throughout the area, and Bounty Hunters also prowl about, but overall it's not that hard to reach home from here.
- We get the odd Zoners in here. They prefer to stay out of the house systems. Usually they're just picking up Light Arms and Consumer Goods for their Freeport out there in Omicron Theta. They'll trade those for Food and other basics, so we don't need to haul those ourselves as much. That lot likes living on the ragged edge, and you'll find it in the Omicron systems.
- We've reached some understandings with the Unioners of late. We'll see how that goes, I'm not wholly trustful of any Rheinlander. Least of all those who are known to deal in Hessian Tears. Still, if they want to profit from the Artifact trade, let them. Another route into Liberty for those doesn't hurt us.

| We sell the Artifacts directly to the Hogosha. There was a time when we went through the GMG, but it is always more profitable to cut out the middleman. That has annoyed those Gas Miners a lot, but that's not my problem. I brought my Artifacts from Alcudia, in Omicron Lambda.I passed out drunk at the observation deck bar a few nights ago - too many of those deadly Omnistellar Gullet Blasters I guess. While I was out someone stole my knife, probably some dirty tourist looking for a souvenir. Whoever took that knife is dead; it has been in my family for six generations.The Alien Artifacts we sell to the Hogosha here come mostly from Crete, but they can be found on a lot of planetary fragments and asteroids as well. We don't know how they got there, and frankly, don't care. These trinkets have no value to us, but they are worth their weight in gold in the houses. You could make a fortune picking up a full load at cost from Crete, then delivering them to any of the Houses. We won't stop you if you want to do that. |

| Rheinland beer isn't that bad really. Myself, I like my tequila better, but we don't get much of that out here and the Hessians left barrels of their stuff behind. Want a beer?Rabat is quite the planet to have this base orbit around. A lot of gases to be mined and used for new weapons or fuel or whatever. Seems like the Hessians just ignored it though, the whole gas mining section was stripped out by them and who knows what they did with it. And to top it all off they caused some structural damage while leaving too. I doubt we'll be mining anything here any time soon.I still can't believe we managed to retake this base. Those Hessian dogs put up some fight. I heard stories a bunch of them got cut off from their escape ships in the engineering section when we landed here, so they locked themselves tight and kept messing around with the station power systems until a bunch of us cut through all the doors a few days later and finally cleaned them out. They are like rats, but big scary ones.We have a colony on the surface of Planet Gran Canaria. A lot of people on Crete look down on those settlers, claiming its not the Corsair way... Myself, I'm worried that without those farms, this base is going to have a harder time supporting us.I'd like to think we've gotten rid of the Hessians in this system. Fat chance. Already my hermanos are coming down with rumours that they got a new operation up north. They keep flooding through that damned jump hole in the nebula cloud next to Tangier, wish we could just close that hole for good.A Bounty Hunter jumped me near the Omega 47 hole in Omega 49 earlier this week. I fought the bastard off, but right after I was done with him a Hessian appeared. My ship was nearly out of supplies by then, so I had a tough fight. I managed to get clear and withdraw to Omega 47, but sustained heavy damage. Right now I'm grounded until my ship is fixed, but once it is, I'm going to pay that Hessian a visit. He will regret having crossed me.This base is ours... for now. Rumour already has it a Hessian counter offensive is on its way. We're a long way from home, hopefully the fleet will get here in time if those Hessians really do try to take this base back. |

- We have a colony on the surface of Planet Gran Canaria. A lot of people on Crete look down on those settlers, claiming its not the Corsair way... Myself, I'm worried that without those farms, this base is going to have a harder time supporting us.
- I'd like to think we've gotten rid of the Hessians in this system. Fat chance. Already my hermanos are coming down with rumours that they got a new operation up north. They keep flooding through that damned jump hole in the nebula cloud next to Tangier, wish we could just close that hole for good.
- A Bounty Hunter jumped me near the Omega 47 hole in Omega 49 earlier this week. I fought the bastard off, but right after I was done with him a Hessian appeared. My ship was nearly out of supplies by then, so I had a tough fight. I managed to get clear and withdraw to Omega 47, but sustained heavy damage. Right now I'm grounded until my ship is fixed, but once it is, I'm going to pay that Hessian a visit. He will regret having crossed me.
- This base is ours... for now. Rumour already has it a Hessian counter offensive is on its way. We're a long way from home, hopefully the fleet will get here in time if those Hessians really do try to take this base back.
Rheinland beer isn't that bad really. Myself, I like my tequila better, but we don't get much of that out here and the Hessians left barrels of their stuff behind. Want a beer?

Rabat is quite the planet to have this base orbit around. A lot of gases to be mined and used for new weapons or fuel or whatever. Seems like the Hessians just ignored it though, the whole gas mining section was stripped out by them and who knows what they did with it. And to top it all off they caused some structural damage while leaving too. I doubt we'll be mining anything here any time soon.

I still can't believe we managed to retake this base. Those Hessian dogs put up some fight. I heard stories a bunch of them got cut off from their escape ships in the engineering section when we landed here, so they locked themselves tight and kept messing around with the station power systems until a bunch of us cut through all the doors a few days later and finally cleaned them out.

| The Corsairs and Outcasts are the survivors of theHispania. Half of the crew left in smaller ships and crawled into Sirius; they became the Corsairs. The rest of theHispaniacrew kept the ship running until it limped close enough to Sirius to abandon; they became the Outcasts. More than fifty percent of both groups died in the first two years after planetfall.We bring a lot of Dublin gold and Cambridge food through this route all the way to Crete. This is why this jump hole is so well defended: we can't let our enemies disrupt this lifeline. This ship is what makes it all possible.We get many different goods and basic supplies from the Freeports in nearby zones. Often times it is easier to buy what we need with Artifact income than to steal it.This battleship is the only thing that protects this nebula cloud from being overrun by the Red Hessians. It's originally designed by the Order, so it's stealthy enough to move within the cloud undetected and beat the Hessians at their own game. They have tried to destroy it by organised assault more times than I can count, but they keep failing because of the cloud density and this ship's stealth mode.Alright, Senor. I'll admit that not all of our munitions workers are here voluntarily. But those are mainly criminals of the worst sort who are paying their debt to the Empire by building munitions to defeat our enemies. Or, some of them are Hessian dogs or Mollys, that is why you see some of them arriving in shackles. I love the irony of that: they must now labor to build the munitions that will defeat their compatriots!Within the Malvadas Cloud you'll find a Jump Hole leading to Omicron Theta. There is another Jump Hole in this system in the Walker Cloud. Be careful, there are mines scattered among the carbon asteroids, but once past those you'll come upon the Jump Hole to Omega-41.The war with the Red Hessians in Omega-5 has cost the Corsairs many ships and pilots. Death is the way of the Corsair, so the lost pilots are regrettable yet acceptable. Much worse is the loss of their ships, which are often passed from one generation to the next. This shipyard is constantly running at full operational capacity to build new fighters for the front.Slavery? How can you say such things, Senor? Slavery is not only illegal within the Empire, it is a terrible and wicked crime. You must not repeat such accusations. If those words reach the wrong ears it could mean great trouble for us here. Not that have done anything wrong, but you know what bureaucratic investigations are like. We have production deadlines to meet here. The Outcasts are the slavers, not noble and honorable Corsairs. Forced prison labor is not slavery. It is justice and a righteous penance for their offenses.In 450 AS we captured our first ship. It was the Rheinland exploration vesselSchiller. Once we dispatched the crew the ship was ours, and more inner colony ships began to disappear. The Corsairs had begun a legacy that lasts to this day. We are pirates; we take what we need.Hola, Senor. Are you by chance the pilot of the transport that just delivered our newest contingent of, ah, shall we say, workers? Munitions manufacturing is a dangerous and exhausting occupation, there's no doubt of that. We burn through workers like an Outcast through cardamine. Ah, well, what I mean to say is, our workers rotate back out to their homes frequently. While here, they are well paid and well treated, I assure you. Let me offer you a drink. |

| Many Bounty Hunters come to this system. It's what we call a target-rich environment. You've got Corsairs, Mollies, Hessians...Even the occasional Gaian that tries to take a vacation down here. Well, the last one that came went for an extended stay on Newgate instead, and the sum I got for it netted me a month's vacation myself. Heh.Hunting Corsairs? No, I'm tracking someone else. My brother to be exact. The lad left Bretonia two weeks ago with the idea of chasing a high-value mark. Last I heared he was headed to Omega-48, but I haven't heared from him since. If the Corsairs already got him, he's a goner, that's for sure.I'm just getting my ship serviced and refuled, after that I'm off to Dublin. After having survived the Omega borderworlds for the past two months, a bit of time in good old Dub is going to be a nice, relaxing change of pace. There's plenty of Corsairs and Mollies out there to make a living as a Hunter.There's a jump hole in the east of this system, which leads to Omega-48. I haven't gone there yet, but I'll head out to find it soon. There's a ton of Corsairs and Hessians down there, along with a few of their bases, so there'll be plenty of marks to collect on. I'll have to be cautious though, I heard tale of entire fleets slugging it out down there. Wouldn't want to get caught in between. |

Oh well, just making sure there is nothing suspicious going on here. Pygar's pretty close to Crete and we'd rather not have a little 'incident' here. That guy over there, though. No, the one with the Order uniform. I swear he's up to something. Can't trust those people, acting all secret. |

We were forced to abandon her and make our way through the void. We found this planet with barely enough supplies to feed half of us. Few crops would grow in these infertile sands, and our numbers dwindled to almost nothing.The Malvada Nube serves as the key adult initiation ritual within the close families of the Corsairs. Young pilots must fly a stripped ship into the cloud, find an Artifact, and return safely to Crete. Almost 30% never return. The radiation levels are high, and it is rumored that there are strange beings that guard the best areas. By tradition, a lost trainee's ship and body are never recovered, just left as a reminder to future generations of failure's cost.Many think our rites of initiation are barbaric, but we can't feed, clothe, and train every Corsair born. The initiation keeps our population problems in check. At the age of sixteen every Corsair must fly into the radioactive Malvadas Cloud in an unshielded ship and return with an Artifact.

We will not tolerate this loathsome practice that has been so heinously promoted by the Outcasts. Those drug abusing degenerates think nothing of exploiting the vulnerable in their quest for cheap cardamine and domination over their peaceful neighbors.

The Zoners at Freeport 5 and Freeport 9 have access to many of the supplies we use at this base. In exchange for the Oxygen and Water we have in abundance here we are able to get all manner of goods.

Corsairs have the purest hearts and are the most fair minded citizens in all of Sirius, I declare! We shall crush the despicable slave trade and its wicked promoters wherever we find them. I have heard far too many rumors of this practice existing at remote Corsair installations. Personally, I do not believe them. The Etna Six were an aberration brought on by extended exposure to Outcasts within the Etna battle zone. Such greed and casual disregard for humanity is totally foreign to the average Corsair.

The Artifacts that end up in Manhattan usually pass through Bretonia's market first. We export Alien Artifacts to the Junker base Trafalgar. I don't suppose there would be anything to stop you from doing the same.

The first outsider accepted by the Corsairs was a freelancer named John Bown. He fought several of our best pilots when he entered the system, so he was able to pass. He left with a cargo bay full of Artifacts, and that is when trade began. Our economy flourished, allowing us to feed more of our people.

| Cadiz is an important base for the Corsairs. It is one of our primary supply depots from which we receive many Commodities.Now that our shipyard is operational, we have begun gathering the components to build a biodome. If we could have one of those domes under direct control of the Corsairs, none of us would ever want again. It would be a new age, a time without hunger. Even now we come closer and closer to it.The MOX that powers this base's larger ships is stolen, usually by our raiders that go into Bretonia. The police there are no threat to our pilots.We get many different goods and basic supplies from the Freeports in nearby zones. Often times it is easier to buy what we need with Artifact income than to steal it.Engine Components, Construction Machinery, and Gold are Commodities that are crucial to our ship-building operations here. They are either stolen or purchased from Trafalgar and shipped here.I don't know why so many resources are going into the construction of capital ships. I mean, they look imposing on the battlefield, but they're so inefficient. They are also cumbersome, and have high crew requirements. That crew could all be flying fighters and bombers instead, which are much more useful in a system like Omega-5.IMG prospectors have been sneaking into the system recently, looking for Artifacts. They don't understand whose space they are entering, until we catch them. Then their last few moments are spent thinking deeply about the subject. The Artifact trade is our resource; anyone who endangers it must be killed.Within the Malvadas Cloud you'll find a Jump Hole leading to Omicron Theta. There is another Jump Hole in this system in the Walker Cloud. Be careful, there are mines scattered among the carbon asteroids, but once past those you'll come upon the Jump Hole to Omega-41.The warships under construction here will cement our reputation as the most fearsome group in all of Sirius. They will allow us to finally break through the defences of the weakening houses, and claim their territory as our own. I can't wait until I can walk on the surface of planet Cambridge. When that day comes, it will all be thanks to these ships.The war with the Red Hessians in Omega-5 has cost the Corsairs many ships and pilots.

It's good to know they like trophies, I think I'll start taking a few to teach them respect.My brethren disagree with me, but destroying the Hood was a mistake. Yes, the Guild were more favorable to the Mollys than us, but it would have at least given us extra power at the bargaining table with the Junkers of Trafalgar. Without this crucial alternative, we're being fleeced for more than we have, this isn't sustainable. And if the Mollys, by some miracle, drag this on for long enough - we will have to withdraw.These so-called Mollys have done us a service. They've driven the Armed Forces out of the system and ripened it for us to rule. The only problem is that our supply chain is.. tenuous at best. If we weren't so inhibited it would be a simple chore to flatten these would-be separatists and send Correos full of gold back to Crete. |

| Most Rogues enjoy a good brawl, but things often get messy. After the last brawl in the bar, I was in Medical for weeks with three busted ribs. Three ribs from one punch! Thank God he wasn't using his knife...There's only two kinds of Rogues that really scare me: Ones short on booze, and ones short on Cardi. Then there's the lot returning from a stay on Sugarland. Those can be unstable and best avoided completely.Rogues got us shipping all sorts of stuff down to Fort McMurray ya? No idea why, but y'know, they pay good money. Mostly. Reckon they got something big going down.So there we were minding our own business in the bar, when this giant monster of a bloke walks up and tells us we're sitting in his chair. We point out it's a Junker base, so it's our bloody chair and he says "Yeah, but it's our system, and if you don't shift I'll rip out your damn spines." That point we realised who he was. We moved.I don't mind Rogues dropping by now and again, but that last one... I thought he was about to rip Martin in half! I think we've got an understanding now, though. We don't get in their way, and they make sure most of their unneeded cargo comes our way.Rogues round these parts are a different breed to the ones you find elsewhere. These poor buggers got the bosses breathing down their necks the whole time. Makes em scared and scared Rogues are scary Rogues. They'll cut you soon as look you. Just in case that's what the boss wants. Makes living here kinda erratic. |

- I don't mind Rogues dropping by now and again, but that last one... I thought he was about to rip Martin in half! I think we've got an understanding now, though. We don't get in their way, and they make sure most of their unneeded cargo comes our way.
- Rogues round these parts are a different breed to the ones you find elsewhere. These poor buggers got the bosses breathing down their necks the whole time. Makes em scared and scared Rogues are scary Rogues. They'll cut you soon as look you. Just in case that's what the boss wants. Makes living here kinda erratic.
Most Rogues enjoy a good brawl, but things often get messy. After the last brawl in the bar, I was in Medical for weeks with three busted ribs. Three ribs from one punch! Thank God he wasn't using his knife...

There's only two kinds of Rogues that really scare me: Ones short on booze, and ones short on Cardi. Then there's the lot returning from a stay on Sugarland. Those can be unstable and best avoided completely.

Rogues got us shipping all sorts of stuff down to Fort McMurray ya? No idea why, but y'know, they pay good money. Mostly. Reckon they got something big going down.

| Battleship Prox |
| These new crew members are really difficult to teach. I was proficient at sharing my knowledge of operating all the previous warships' the interior systems, but applying that knowledge to future Tribunus personnel is a whole different challenge. They're using technology I've never seen before - and I’ve been in this business for a long time. I suppose I’ll get used to it eventually, but it feels like I’m learning the trade all over again.My friends and I train various rookie capital ship crews here on Prox. It feels good to be among the best, especially in times when many don’t make it to their later years. We get plenty of perks for the job - first pick of the food, clean places to relax. The only real drawback is keeping any information about Prox a secret. But for benefits like this, I wouldn’t tell a soul.I love the Prox. It stands as a magnificent display of strength and serves as an excellent education center. Who cares if it can't leave Gamma? It never needs to. I'll be a happy man retiring here. |
